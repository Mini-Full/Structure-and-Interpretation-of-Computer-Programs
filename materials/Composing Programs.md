# Composing Programs

Welcome to [Composing Programs](http://www.composingprograms.com), a free online introduction to programming and computer science. 	

In the tradition of [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), this text focuses on methods for abstraction, programming paradigms, and techniques for managing the complexity of large programs. These concepts are illustrated primarily using the [Python 3](http://www.python.org) programming language. 	

In addition to reading the chapters below, you can apply your knowledge to the [programming projects](http://composingprograms.com/projects.html) that accompany the text and visualize program execution using the [Online Python Tutor](http://composingprograms.com/tutor.html).

# Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Functions

## 1.1 Getting Started

Computer science is a tremendously broad academic discipline. The areas of globally distributed systems, artificial intelligence, robotics, graphics, security, scientific computing, computer architecture, and dozens of emerging sub-fields all expand with new techniques and discoveries every year. The rapid progress of computer science has left few aspects of human life unaffected. Commerce, communication, science, art, leisure, and politics have all been reinvented as computational domains.

The high productivity of computer science is only possible because the discipline is built upon an elegant and powerful set of fundamental ideas. **All computing begins with representing information, specifying logic to process it, and designing abstractions that manage the complexity of that logic.** Mastering these fundamentals will require us to understand precisely how computers interpret computer programs and carry out computational processes.

These fundamental ideas have long been taught using the classic textbook *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* ([SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp)). This text borrows heavily from that textbook.

### 1.1.1 Programming in Python

> A language isn't something you learn so much as something you join.
>
> —[Arika Okrent](http://arikaokrent.com/)

In order to define computational processes, we need a programming language; preferably one that many humans and a great variety of computers can all understand. In this text, we will work primarily with the [Python](http://docs.python.org/py3k/) language.

Python is a widely used programming language that has recruited enthusiasts from many professions: web programmers, game engineers, scientists, academics, and even designers of new programming languages. When you learn Python, you join a million-person-strong community of developers. Developer communities are tremendously important institutions: members help each other solve problems, share their projects and experiences, and collectively develop software and tools. Dedicated members often achieve celebrity and widespread esteem for their contributions.

The Python language itself is the product of a [large volunteer community](http://www.python.org/psf/members/) that prides itself on the [diversity](http://python.org/community/diversity/) of its contributors. The language was conceived and first implemented by [Guido van Rossum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in the late 1980's. The first chapter of his [Python 3 Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/appetite.html) explains why Python is so popular, among the many languages available today.

Python excels as an instructional language because, throughout its history, Python's developers have emphasized the human interpretability of Python code, reinforced by the [Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) guiding principles of beauty, simplicity, and readability. Python is particularly appropriate for this text because its broad set of features support a variety of different programming styles, which we will explore. While there is no single way to program in Python, there are a set of conventions shared across the developer community that facilitate reading, understanding, and extending existing programs. Python's combination of great flexibility and accessibility allows students to explore many programming paradigms, and then apply their newly acquired knowledge to thousands of [ongoing projects](http://pypi.python.org/pypi).

These notes maintain the spirit of [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp) by introducing the features of Python in step with techniques for abstraction and a rigorous model of computation. In addition, these notes provide a practical introduction to Python programming, including some advanced language features and illustrative examples. Increasing your facility with Python should come naturally as you progress through the text.

The best way to get started programming in Python is to interact with the interpreter directly. This section describes how to install Python 3, initiate an interactive session with the interpreter, and start programming.

### 1.1.2 Installing Python 3

As with all great software, Python has many versions. This text will use the most recent stable version of Python 3. Many computers have older versions of Python installed already, such as Python 2.7, but those will not match the descriptions in this text. You should be able to use any computer, but expect to install Python 3. (Don't worry, Python is free.)

You can download Python 3 from the Python downloads page by clicking on the version that begins with 3 (not 2). Follow the instructions of the installer to complete installation.

For further guidance, try these video tutorials on [Windows installation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54-wuFsPi0w) and [Mac installation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smHuBHxJdK8) of Python 3, created by Julia Oh.

### 1.1.3 Interactive Sessions

In an interactive Python session, you type some Python *code* after the *prompt*, `>>>`. The Python *interpreter* reads and executes what you type, carrying out your various commands.

To start an interactive session, run the Python 3 application. Type `python3` at a terminal prompt (Mac/Unix/Linux) or open the Python 3 application in Windows.

If you see the Python prompt, `>>>`, then you have successfully started an interactive session. These notes depict example interactions using the prompt, followed by some input.

```
>>> 2 + 2
4
```

**Interactive controls.** Each session keeps a history of what you have typed. To access that history, press `<Control>-P` (previous) and `<Control>-N` (next). `<Control>-D` exits a session, which discards this history. Up and down arrows also cycle through history on some systems.

### 1.1.4 First Example

**Statements & Expressions**. Python code consists of expressions and statements. Broadly, computer programs consist of instructions to either

1. **Compute some value**
2. **Carry out some action**

**Statements typically describe actions.** When the Python interpreter executes a statement, it carries out the corresponding action. **On the other hand, expressions typically describe computations.** When Python evaluates an expression, it computes the value of that expression. This chapter introduces several types of statements and expressions.

**Functions**. **Functions encapsulate logic that manipulates data.** Functions are the primary topic of this chapter.

**Objects**. **An object bundles together data and the logic that manipulates that data, in a way that manages the complexity of both.** Objects are the primary topic of Chapter 2.

**Interpreters**. Evaluating compound expressions requires a precise procedure that interprets code in a predictable way. A program that implements such a procedure, evaluating compound expressions, is called an interpreter. The design and implementation of interpreters is the primary topic of Chapter 3.

When compared with other computer programs, interpreters for programming languages are unique in their **generality**. Python was not designed with Shakespeare in mind. However, its great flexibility allowed us to process a large amount of text with only a few statements and expressions.

In the end, we will find that all of these core concepts are closely related: functions are objects, objects are functions, and interpreters are instances of both. However, developing a clear understanding of each of these concepts and their role in organizing code is critical to mastering the art of programming.

### 1.1.5 Errors

Python is waiting for your command. You are encouraged to experiment with the language, even though you may not yet know its full vocabulary and structure. However, be prepared for errors. While computers are tremendously fast and flexible, they are also extremely rigid. The nature of computers is described in [Stanford's introductory course](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/code-1-introduction.html) as

> The fundamental equation of computers is:
>
> ```
> computer = powerful + stupid
> ```
>
> Computers are very powerful, looking at volumes of data very quickly. **Computers can perform billions of operations per second, where each operation is pretty simple.**
>
> Computers are also shockingly stupid and fragile. The operations that they can do are extremely rigid, simple, and mechanical. **The computer lacks anything like real insight** ... it's nothing like the HAL 9000 from the movies. If nothing else, you should not be intimidated by the computer as if it's some sort of brain. It's very mechanical underneath it all.
>
> **Programming is about a person using their real insight to build something useful, constructed out of these teeny, simple little operations that the computer can do.**
>
> —Francisco Cai and Nick Parlante, Stanford CS101

The rigidity of computers will immediately become apparent as you experiment with the Python interpreter: even the smallest spelling and formatting changes will cause unexpected output and errors.

Learning to interpret errors and diagnose the cause of unexpected errors is called *debugging*. Some guiding principles of debugging are:

1. **Test incrementally**: **Every well-written program is composed of small, modular components that can be tested individually.** Try out everything you write as soon as possible to identify problems early and gain confidence in your components.
2. **Isolate errors**: An error in the output of a statement can typically be attributed to a particular modular component. **When trying to diagnose a problem, trace the error to the smallest fragment of code you can before trying to correct it.**
3. **Check your assumptions**: Interpreters do carry out your instructions to the letter — no more and no less. Their output is unexpected when the behavior of some code does not match what the programmer believes (or assumes) that behavior to be. **Know your assumptions, then focus your debugging effort on verifying that your assumptions actually hold.**
4. **Consult others**: You are not alone! If you don't understand an error message, ask a friend, instructor, or search engine. If you have isolated an error, but can't figure out how to correct it, ask someone else to take a look. A lot of valuable programming knowledge is shared in the process of group problem solving.

**Incremental testing, modular design, precise assumptions, and teamwork** are themes that persist throughout this text. Hopefully, they will also persist throughout your computer science career.

## 1.2 Elements of Programming

A programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about computational processes. Programs serve to communicate those ideas among the members of a programming community. **Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.**

When we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three such mechanisms:

- **primitive expressions and statements**, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,
- **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
- **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: functions and data. (Soon we will discover that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is stuff that we want to manipulate, and functions describe the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive functions, as well as have some methods for combining and abstracting both functions and data.

### 1.2.1 Expressions

Having experimented with the full Python interpreter in the previous section, we now start anew, methodically developing the Python language element by element.

We begin with primitive expressions. One kind of primitive expression is a number. More precisely, the expression that you type consists of the numerals that represent the number in base 10.

```
>>> 42
42
```

Expressions representing numbers may be combined with mathematical operators to form a compound expression, which the interpreter will evaluate:

```
>>> -1 - -1
0
>>> 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + 1/128
0.9921875
```

These mathematical expressions use *infix* notation, where the *operator* (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`) appears in between the *operands* (numbers). Python includes many ways to form compound expressions. Rather than attempt to enumerate them all immediately, we will introduce new expression forms as we go, along with the language features that they support.

### 1.2.2 Call Expressions

The most important kind of compound expression is a ***call expression***, which **applies a function to some arguments**. Recall from algebra that the mathematical notion of a function is a mapping from some input arguments to an output value. For instance, the `max` function maps its inputs to a single output, which is the largest of the inputs. The way in which Python expresses function application is the same as in conventional mathematics.

```
>>> max(7.5, 9.5)
9.5
```

This call expression has subexpressions: the *operator* is an expression that precedes parentheses, which enclose a comma-delimited list of *operand* expressions.

![image-20211030150135560](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030150135560.png)

The operator specifies a *function*. When this call expression is evaluated, we say that the function `max` is ***called*** with *arguments* 7.5 and 9.5, and ***returns*** a *value* of 9.5.

The order of the arguments in a call expression matters. For instance, the function `pow` raises its first argument to the power of its second argument.

```
>>> pow(100, 2)
10000
>>> pow(2, 100)
1267650600228229401496703205376
```

Function notation has three principal advantages over the mathematical convention of infix notation. First, **functions may take an arbitrary number of arguments**:

```
>>> max(1, -2, 3, -4)
3
```

No ambiguity can arise, because the function name always precedes its arguments.

Second, **function notation extends in a straightforward way to *nested* expressions**, where the elements are themselves compound expressions. In nested call expressions, unlike compound infix expressions, the structure of the nesting is entirely explicit in the parentheses.

```
>>> max(min(1, -2), min(pow(3, 5), -4))
-2
```

There is no limit (in principle) to the depth of such nesting and to the overall complexity of the expressions that the Python interpreter can evaluate. However, humans quickly get confused by multi-level nesting. An important role for you as a programmer is to structure expressions so that they remain interpretable by yourself, your programming partners, and other people who may read your expressions in the future.

Third, mathematical notation has a great variety of forms: multiplication appears between terms, exponents appear as superscripts, division as a horizontal bar, and a square root as a roof with slanted siding. Some of this notation is very hard to type! However, **all of this complexity can be unified via the notation of call expressions**. While Python supports common mathematical operators using infix notation (like `+` and `-`), any operator can be expressed as a function with a name.

### 1.2.3 Importing Library Functions

Python defines a very large number of functions, including the operator functions mentioned in the preceding section, but does not make all of their names available by default. Instead, it organizes the functions and other quantities that it knows about into modules, which together comprise the Python Library. To use these elements, one imports them. For example, the `math` module provides a variety of familiar mathematical functions:

```
>>> from math import sqrt
>>> sqrt(256)
16.0
```

and the `operator` module provides access to functions corresponding to infix operators:

```
>>> from operator import add, sub, mul
>>> add(14, 28)
42
>>> sub(100, mul(7, add(8, 4)))
16
```

An `import` statement designates a module name (e.g., `operator` or `math`), and then lists the named attributes of that module to import (e.g., `sqrt`). Once a function is imported, it can be called multiple times.

There is no difference between using these operator functions (e.g., `add`) and the operator symbols themselves (e.g., `+`). Conventionally, most programmers use symbols and infix notation to express simple arithmetic.

The [Python 3 Library Docs](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/index.html) list the functions defined by each module, such as the [math module](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/math.html). However, this documentation is written for developers who know the whole language well. For now, you may find that experimenting with a function tells you more about its behavior than reading the documentation. As you become familiar with the Python language and vocabulary, this documentation will become a valuable reference source.

### 1.2.4 Names and the Environment

A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for using names to refer to computational objects. If a value has been given a name, we say that the name ***binds*** to the value.

In Python, we can establish new bindings using the assignment statement, which contains a name to the left of `=` and a value to the right:

```
>>> radius = 10
>>> radius
10
>>> 2 * radius
20
```

Names are also bound via `import` statements.

```
>>> from math import pi
>>> pi * 71 / 223
1.0002380197528042
```

The `=` symbol is called the *assignment* operator in Python (and many other languages). **Assignment is our simplest means of *abstraction*, for it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations.** In this way, complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity.

The possibility of binding names to values and later retrieving those values by name means that the interpreter must maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the names, values, and bindings. This memory is called an ***environment***.

Names can also be bound to functions. For instance, the name `max` is bound to the max function we have been using. Functions, unlike numbers, are tricky to render as text, so Python prints an identifying description instead, when asked to describe a function:

```
>>> max
<built-in function max>
```

We can use assignment statements to give new names to existing functions.

```
>>> f = max
>>> f
<built-in function max>
>>> f(2, 3, 4)
4
```

And successive assignment statements can rebind a name to a new value.

```
>>> f = 2
>>> f
2
```

In Python, names are often called ***variable names*** or ***variables*** because they can be bound to different values in the course of executing a program. When a name is bound to a new value through assignment, it is no longer bound to any previous value. One can even bind built-in names to new values.

```
>>> max = 5
>>> max
5
```

After assigning `max` to 5, the name `max` is no longer bound to a function, and so attempting to call `max(2, 3, 4)` will cause an error.

When executing an assignment statement, Python evaluates the expression to the right of `=` before changing the binding to the name on the left. Therefore, one can refer to a name in right-side expression, even if it is the name to be bound by the assignment statement.

```
>>> x = 2
>>> x = x + 1
>>> x
3
```

We can also assign multiple values to multiple names in a single statement, where names on the left of `=` and expressions on the right of `=` are separated by commas.

```
>>> area, circumference = pi * radius * radius, 2 * pi * radius
>>> area
314.1592653589793
>>> circumference
62.83185307179586
```

Changing the value of one name does not affect other names. Below, even though the name `area` was bound to a value defined originally in terms of `radius`, the value of `area` has not changed. Updating the value of `area` requires another assignment statement.

```
>>> radius = 11
>>> area
314.1592653589793
>>> area = pi * radius * radius
380.132711084365
```

With multiple assignment, ***all* expressions to the right of `=` are evaluated before *any* names to the left are bound to those values.** As a result of this rule, swapping the values bound to two names can be performed in a single statement.

```
>>> x, y = 3, 4.5
>>> y, x = x, y
>>> x
4.5
>>> y
3
```

### 1.2.5 Evaluating Nested Expressions

One of our goals in this chapter is to isolate issues about thinking procedurally. As a case in point, let us consider that, in evaluating nested call expressions, the interpreter is itself following a procedure.

To evaluate a call expression, Python will do the following:

1. **Evaluate the operator and operand subexpressions, then**
2. **Apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpression to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpressions.**

Even this simple procedure illustrates some important points about processes in general. The first step dictates that in order to accomplish the evaluation process for a call expression we must first evaluate other expressions. Thus, the evaluation procedure is *recursive* in nature; that is, it includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.

For example, evaluating

```
>>> sub(pow(2, add(1, 10)), pow(2, 5))
2016
```

requires that this evaluation procedure be applied four times. If we draw each expression that we evaluate, we can visualize the hierarchical structure of this process.

![image-20211030150301446](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030150301446.png)

This illustration is called an ***expression tree***. In computer science, trees conventionally grow from the top down. The objects at each point in a tree are called **nodes**; in this case, they are expressions paired with their values.

Evaluating its root, the full expression at the top, requires first evaluating the branches that are its subexpressions. The **leaf expressions** (that is, nodes with no branches stemming from them) represent either functions or numbers. The interior nodes have two parts: the call expression to which our evaluation rule is applied, and the result of that expression. Viewing evaluation in terms of this tree, we can imagine that the values of the operands percolate upward, starting from the terminal nodes and then combining at higher and higher levels.

Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us to the point where we need to evaluate, not call expressions, but primitive expressions such as numerals (e.g., 2) and names (e.g., `add`). We take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that

- A numeral evaluates to the number it names,
- A name evaluates to the value associated with that name in the current environment.

Notice the important role of an environment in determining the meaning of the symbols in expressions. In Python, it is meaningless to speak of the value of an expression such as

```
>>> add(x, 1)
```

without specifying any information about the environment that would provide a meaning for the name `x` (or even for the name `add`). Environments provide the context in which evaluation takes place, which plays an important role in our understanding of program execution.

This evaluation procedure does not suffice to evaluate all Python code, only call expressions, numerals, and names. For instance, it does not handle assignment statements. Executing

```
>>> x = 3
```

does not return a value nor evaluate a function on some arguments, since the purpose of assignment is instead to bind a name to a value. **In general, statements are not evaluated but *executed*; they do not produce a value but instead make some change.** Each type of expression or statement has its own evaluation or execution procedure.

A pedantic note: when we say that "a numeral evaluates to a number," we actually mean that the Python interpreter evaluates a numeral to a number. It is the interpreter which endows meaning to the programming language. Given that the interpreter is a fixed program that always behaves consistently, we can say that numerals (and expressions) themselves evaluate to values in the context of Python programs.

### 1.2.6 The Non-Pure Print Function

Throughout this text, we will distinguish between two types of functions.

**Pure functions.** <u>Functions have some input (their arguments) and return some output (the result of applying them).</u> The built-in function

```
>>> abs(-2)
2
```

can be depicted as a small machine that takes input and produces output.

![image-20211030150359198](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030150359198.png)

The function `abs` is *pure*. **Pure functions have the property that applying them has no effects beyond returning a value. Moreover, a pure function must always return the same value when called twice with the same arguments.**

**Non-pure functions.** In addition to returning a value, applying a non-pure function can generate *side effects*, which make some change to the state of the interpreter or computer. A common side effect is to generate additional output beyond the return value, using the `print` function.

```
>>> print(1, 2, 3)
1 2 3
```

While `print` and `abs` may appear to be similar in these examples, they work in fundamentally different ways. **The value that `print` returns is always `None`, a special Python value that represents nothing.** The interactive Python interpreter does not automatically print the value `None`. In the case of `print`, the function itself is printing output as a side effect of being called.

![image-20211030150410894](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030150410894.png)

A nested expression of calls to `print` highlights the non-pure character of the function.

```
>>> print(print(1), print(2))
1
2
None None
```

If you find this output to be unexpected, draw an expression tree to clarify why evaluating this expression produces this peculiar output.

Be careful with `print`! The fact that it returns `None` means that it *should not* be the expression in an assignment statement.

```
>>> two = print(2)
2
>>> print(two)
None
```

Pure functions are restricted in that they cannot have side effects or change behavior over time. Imposing these restrictions yields substantial benefits. First, **pure functions can be composed more reliably into compound call expressions**. We can see in the non-pure function example above that `print` does not return a useful result when used in an operand expression. On the other hand, we have seen that functions such as `max`, `pow` and `sqrt` can be used effectively in nested expressions.

Second, **pure functions tend to be simpler to test**. A list of arguments will always lead to the same return value, which can be compared to the expected return value. Testing is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

Third, Chapter 4 will illustrate that **pure functions are essential for writing *concurrent* programs, in which multiple call expressions may be evaluated simultaneously**.

By contrast, Chapter 2 investigates a range of non-pure functions and describes their uses.

For these reasons, we concentrate heavily on creating and using pure functions in the remainder of this chapter. The `print` function is only used so that we can see the intermediate results of computations.

## 1.3 Defining New Functions

We have identified in Python some of the elements that must appear in any powerful programming language:

1. Numbers and arithmetic operations are *primitive* built-in data values and functions.
2. Nested function application provides a means of *combining* operations.
3. Binding names to values provides a limited means of *abstraction*.

Now we will learn about *function definitions*, a much more powerful abstraction technique by which a name can be bound to compound operation, which can then be referred to as a unit.

We begin by examining how to express the idea of *squaring*. We might say, "To square something, multiply it by itself." This is expressed in Python as

```
>>> def square(x):
		return mul(x, x)
```

which defines a new function that has been given the name `square`. This user-defined function is not built into the interpreter. It represents the compound operation of multiplying something by itself. The `x` in this definition is called a ***formal parameter***, which provides a name for the thing to be multiplied. The definition creates this user-defined function and associates it with the name `square`.

**How to define a function.** Function definitions consist of a `def` statement that indicates a `<name>` and a comma-separated list of named `<formal parameters>`, then a `return` statement, called the function body, that specifies the `<return expression>` of the function, which is an expression to be evaluated whenever the function is applied:

```
def <name>(<formal parameters>):
	return <return expression>
```

The second line *must* be indented — most programmers use four spaces to indent. The return expression is not evaluated right away; it is stored as part of the newly defined function and evaluated only when the function is eventually applied.

Having defined `square`, we can apply it with a call expression:

```
>>> square(21)
441
>>> square(add(2, 5))
49
>>> square(square(3))
81
```

We can also use `square` as a building block in defining other functions. For example, we can easily define a function `sum_squares` that, given any two numbers as arguments, returns the sum of their squares:

```
>>> def sum_squares(x, y):
		return add(square(x), square(y))
>>> sum_squares(3, 4)
25
```

User-defined functions are used in exactly the same way as built-in functions. Indeed, one cannot tell from the definition of `sum_squares` whether `square` is built into the interpreter, imported from a module, or defined by the user.

**Both `def` statements and assignment statements bind names to values, and any existing bindings are lost.** For example, `g` below first refers to a function of no arguments, then a number, and then a different function of two arguments.

```
>>> def g():
		return 1
>>> g()
1
>>> g = 2
>>> g
2
>>> def g(h, i):
		return h + i
>>> g(1, 2)
3
```

### 1.3.1 Environments

Our subset of Python is now complex enough that the meaning of programs is non-obvious. What if a formal parameter has the same name as a built-in function? Can two functions share names without confusion? To resolve such questions, we must describe environments in more detail.

An environment in which an expression is evaluated consists of a sequence of ***frames***, depicted as boxes. Each frame contains ***bindings***, each of which associates a name with its corresponding value. There is a single *global* frame. Assignment and import statements add entries to the first frame of the current environment. So far, our environment consists only of the global frame.

![image-20211030123313103](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030123313103.png)

This ***environment diagram*** shows the bindings of the current environment, along with the values to which names are bound. The environment diagrams in this text are interactive: you can step through the lines of the small program on the left to see the state of the environment evolve on the right. You can also click on the "Edit code in Online Python Tutor" link to load the example into the [Online Python Tutor](http://composingprograms.com/tutor.html), a tool created by [Philip Guo](http://www.pgbovine.net/) for generating these environment diagrams. You are encouraged to create examples yourself and study the resulting environment diagrams.

Functions appear in environment diagrams as well. An `import` statement binds a name to a built-in function. A `def` statement binds a name to a user-defined function created by the definition. The resulting environment after importing `mul` and defining `square` appears below:

![image-20211030123703145](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030123703145.png)

Each function is a line that starts with `func`, followed by the function name and formal parameters. **Built-in functions such as `mul` do not have formal parameter names, and so `...` is always used instead.**

The name of a function is repeated twice, once in the frame and again as part of the function itself. The name appearing in the function is called the *intrinsic name*. The name in a frame is a *bound name*. There is a difference between the two: different names may refer to the same function, but that function itself has only one intrinsic name.

The name bound to a function in a frame is the one used during evaluation. The intrinsic name of a function does not play a role in evaluation. Step through the example below using the *Forward* button to see that once the name `max` is bound to the value 3, it can no longer be used as a function.

![image-20211030124642075](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030124642075.png)

The error message `TypeError: 'int' object is not callable` is reporting that the name `max` (currently bound to the number 3) is an integer and not a function. Therefore, it cannot be used as the operator in a call expression.

**Function Signatures.** Functions differ in the number of arguments that they are allowed to take. To track these requirements, we draw each function in a way that shows the function name and its formal parameters. The user-defined function `square` takes only `x`; providing more or fewer arguments will result in an error. **A description of the formal parameters of a function is called the function's signature.**

The function `max` can take an arbitrary number of arguments. It is rendered as `max(...)`. **Regardless of the number of arguments taken, all built-in functions will be rendered as `<name>(...)`, because these primitive functions were never explicitly defined.**

> There is a one-to-one correspondence between frame and environment. For every environment there's a first frame. So an environment is the sequence of frames that starts with a particular frame and also includes its parent, and if it has a parent then you can get a whole chain of frames in an environment.

### 1.3.2 Calling User-Defined Functions

To evaluate a call expression whose operator names a user-defined function, the Python interpreter follows a computational process. As with any call expression, the interpreter evaluates the operator and operand expressions, and then applies the named function to the resulting arguments.

Applying a user-defined function introduces a second ***local* frame**, which is only accessible to that function. To apply a user-defined function to some arguments:

1. **Bind the arguments to the names of the function's formal parameters in a new *local* frame.**
2. **Execute the body of the function in the environment that starts with this frame.**

The environment in which the body is evaluated consists of two frames: first the local frame that contains formal parameter bindings, then the global frame that contains everything else. Each instance of a function application has its own independent local frame.

To illustrate an example in detail, several steps of the environment diagram for the same example are depicted below. After executing the first import statement, only the name `mul` is bound in the global frame.

![image-20211030154612627](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030154612627.png)

First, the definition statement for the function `square` is executed. Notice that the entire `def` statement is processed in a single step. The body of a function is not executed until the function is called (not when it is defined).

![image-20211030154627207](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030154627207.png)

Next, The `square` function is called with the argument `-2`, and so a new frame is created with the formal parameter `x` bound to the value `-2`.

![image-20211030154740416](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030154740416.png)

Then, the name `x` is looked up in the current environment, which consists of the two frames shown. In both occurrences, `x` evaluates to `-2`, and so the `square` function returns 4.

![image-20211030155106610](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030155106610.png)

The "Return value" in the `square()` frame is not a name binding; instead it indicates the value returned by the function call that created the frame.

Even in this simple example, two different environments are used. The top-level expression `square(-2)` is evaluated in the global environment, while the return expression `mul(x, x)` is evaluated in the environment created for by calling `square`. Both `x` and `mul` are bound in this environment, but in different frames.

The order of frames in an environment affects the value returned by looking up a name in an expression. We stated previously that a name is evaluated to the value associated with that name in the current environment. We can now be more precise:

**Name Evaluation.** <u>A name evaluates to the value bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment in which that name is found.</u>

Our conceptual framework of environments, names, and functions constitutes a ***model of evaluation***; while some mechanical details are still unspecified (e.g., how a binding is implemented), our model does precisely and correctly describe how the interpreter evaluates call expressions. In Chapter 3 we will see how this model can serve as a blueprint for implementing a working interpreter for a programming language.

### 1.3.3 Example: Calling a User-Defined Function

Let us again consider our two simple function definitions and illustrate the process that evaluates a call expression for a user-defined function.

![image-20211030161126095](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030161126095.png)

Python first evaluates the name `sum_squares`, which is bound to a user-defined function in the global frame. The primitive numeric expressions 5 and 12 evaluate to the numbers they represent.

Next, Python applies `sum_squares`, which introduces a local frame that binds x to 5 and y to 12.

![image-20211030162728514](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030162728514.png)

The body of `sum_squares` contains this call expression:

```
  add     (  square(x)  ,  square(y)  )
________     _________     _________
operator     operand 0     operand 1
```

All three subexpressions are evaluated in the current environment, which begins with the frame labeled `sum_squares()`. The operator subexpression `add` is a name found in the global frame, bound to the built-in function for addition. The two operand subexpressions must be evaluated in turn, before addition is applied. Both operands are evaluated in the current environment beginning with the frame labeled `sum_squares`.

In `operand 0`, `square` names a user-defined function in the global frame, while `x` names the number 5 in the local frame. Python applies `square` to 5 by introducing yet another local frame that binds x to 5.

![image-20211030163412751](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030163412751.png)

Using this environment, the expression `mul(x, x)` evaluates to 25.

Our evaluation procedure now turns to `operand 1`, for which `y` names the number 12. Python evaluates the body of `square` again, this time introducing yet another local frame that binds `x` to 12. Hence, `operand 1` evaluates to 144.

![image-20211030163634959](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030163634959.png)

Finally, applying addition to the arguments 25 and 144 yields a final return value for `sum_squares`: 169.

![image-20211030163736266](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211030163736266.png)

This example illustrates many of the fundamental ideas we have developed so far. Names are bound to values, which are distributed across many independent local frames, along with a single global frame that contains shared names. **A new local frame is introduced every time a function is called, even if the same function is called twice.**

All of this machinery exists to ensure that names resolve to the correct values at the correct times during program execution. This example illustrates why our model requires the complexity that we have introduced. <u>All three local frames contain a binding for the name `x`, but that name is bound to different values in different frames. Local frames keep these names separate.</u>

### 1.3.4 Local Names

One detail of a function's implementation that should not affect the function's behavior is the implementer's choice of names for the function's formal parameters. Thus, the following functions should provide the same behavior:

```
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x)
>>> def square(y):
        return mul(y, y)
```

This principle -- that the meaning of a function should be independent of the parameter names chosen by its author -- has important consequences for programming languages. <u>The simplest consequence is that the parameter names of a function must remain local to the body of the function.</u>

If the parameters were not local to the bodies of their respective functions, then the parameter `x` in `square` could be confused with the parameter `x` in `sum_squares`. Critically, this is not the case: the binding for `x` in different local frames are unrelated. The model of computation is carefully designed to ensure this independence.

We say that the ***scope*** of a local name is limited to the body of the user-defined function that defines it. When a name is no longer accessible, it is out of scope. This scoping behavior isn't a new fact about our model; it is a consequence of the way environments work.

> Within the body of a function, if you use the same name multiple times, it has to refer to the same frame.
>

>
> UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment      

### 1.3.5 Choosing Names

The interchangeability of names does not imply that formal parameter names do not matter at all. On the contrary, well-chosen function and parameter names are essential for the human interpretability of function definitions!

The following guidelines are adapted from the [style guide for Python code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008), which serves as a guide for all (non-rebellious) Python programmers. A shared set of conventions smooths communication among members of a developer community. As a side effect of following these conventions, you will find that your code becomes more internally consistent.

1. **Function names are lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Descriptive names are encouraged.**
2. **Function names typically evoke operations applied to arguments by the interpreter (e.g., `print`, `add`, `square`) or the name of the quantity that results (e.g., `max`, `abs`, `sum`).**
3. **Parameter names are lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Single-word names are preferred.**
4. **Parameter names should evoke the role of the parameter in the function, not just the kind of argument that is allowed.**
5. **Single letter parameter names are acceptable when their role is obvious, but avoid "l" (lowercase ell), "O" (capital oh), or "I" (capital i) to avoid confusion with numerals.**

There are many exceptions to these guidelines, even in the Python standard library. Like the vocabulary of the English language, Python has inherited words from a variety of contributors, and the result is not always consistent.

### 1.3.6 Functions as Abstractions

Though it is very simple, `sum_squares` exemplifies the most powerful property of user-defined functions. <u>The function `sum_squares` is defined in terms of the function `square`, but relies only on the relationship that `square` defines between its input arguments and its output values.</u>

We can write `sum_squares` without concerning ourselves with *how* to square a number. The details of how the square is computed can be suppressed, to be considered at a later time. Indeed, as far as `sum_squares` is concerned, `square` is not a particular function body, but rather an abstraction of a function, a so-called <u>functional abstraction</u>. At this level of abstraction, any function that computes the square is equally good.

Thus, considering only the values they return, the following two functions for squaring a number should be indistinguishable. Each takes a numerical argument and produces the square of that number as the value.

```
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x)
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x-1) + x
```

In other words, **a function definition should be able to suppress details.** The users of the function may not have written the function themselves, but may have obtained it from another programmer as a "black box". A programmer should not need to know how the function is implemented in order to use it. The Python Library has this property. Many developers use the functions defined there, but few ever inspect their implementation.

**Aspects of a functional abstraction.** To master the use of a functional abstraction, it is often useful to consider its three core attributes. The ***domain*** of a function is the set of arguments it can take. The ***range*** of a function is the set of values it can return. The ***intent*** of a function is the relationship it computes between inputs and output (as well as any side effects it might generate). Understanding functional abstractions via their domain, range, and intent is critical to using them correctly in a complex program.

For example, any `square` function that we use to implement `sum_squares` should have these attributes:

- The *domain* is any single real number.
- The *range* is any non-negative real number.
- The *intent* is that the output is the square of the input.

These attributes do not specify how the intent is carried out; that detail is abstracted away.

### 1.3.7 Operators

Mathematical operators (such as `+` and `-`) provided our first example of a method of combination, but we have yet to define an evaluation procedure for expressions that contain these operators.

Python expressions with infix operators each have their own evaluation procedures, but you can often think of them as short-hand for call expressions. When you see

```
>>> 2 + 3
5
```

simply consider it to be short-hand for

```
>>> add(2, 3)
5
```

Infix notation can be nested, just like call expressions. Python applies the normal mathematical rules of operator precedence, which dictate how to interpret a compound expression with multiple operators.

```
>>> 2 + 3 * 4 + 5
19
```

evaluates to the same result as

```
>>> add(add(2, mul(3, 4)), 5)
19
```

The nesting in the call expression is more explicit than the operator version, but also harder to read. Python also allows subexpression grouping with parentheses, to override the normal precedence rules or make the nested structure of an expression more explicit.

```
>>> (2 + 3) * (4 + 5)
45
```

evaluates to the same result as

```
>>> mul(add(2, 3), add(4, 5))
45
```

When it comes to division, Python provides two infix operators: `/` and `//`. The former is normal division, so that it results in a ***floating point***, or decimal value, even if the divisor evenly divides the dividend:

```
>>> 5 / 4
1.25
>>> 8 / 4
2.0
```

The `//` operator, on the other hand, rounds the result down to an integer:

```
>>> 5 // 4
1
>>> -5 // 4
-2
```

These two operators are shorthand for the `truediv` and `floordiv` functions.

```
>>> from operator import truediv, floordiv
>>> truediv(5, 4)
1.25
>>> floordiv(5, 4)
1
```

You should feel free to use infix operators and parentheses in your programs. Idiomatic Python prefers operators over call expressions for simple mathematical operations.

## 1.4 Designing Functions

Functions are an essential ingredient of all programs, large and small, and serve as our primary medium to express computational processes in a programming language. So far, we have discussed the formal properties of functions and how they are applied. We now turn to the topic of what makes a good function. <u>Fundamentally, the qualities of good functions all reinforce the idea that functions are abstractions.</u>

- **Each function should have exactly one job.** That job should be identifiable with a short name and characterizable in a single line of text. Functions that perform multiple jobs in sequence should be divided into multiple functions.
- ***Don't repeat yourself*** is a central tenet of software engineering. The so-called DRY principle states that multiple fragments of code should not describe redundant logic. Instead, that logic should be implemented once, given a name, and applied multiple times. If you find yourself copying and pasting a block of code, you have probably found an opportunity for functional abstraction.
- **Functions should be defined generally.** Squaring is not in the Python Library precisely because it is a special case of the `pow` function, which raises numbers to arbitrary powers.

These guidelines improve the readability of code, reduce the number of errors, and often minimize the total amount of code written. Decomposing a complex task into concise functions is a skill that takes experience to master. Fortunately, Python provides several features to support your efforts.

### 1.4.1 Documentation

A function definition will often include documentation describing the function, called a ***docstring***, which must be indented along with the function body. Docstrings are conventionally triple quoted. <u>The first line describes the job of the function in one line. The following lines can describe arguments and clarify the behavior of the function:</u>

```
>>> def pressure(v, t, n):
        """Compute the pressure in pascals of an ideal gas.

        Applies the ideal gas law: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law

        v -- volume of gas, in cubic meters
        t -- absolute temperature in degrees kelvin
        n -- particles of gas
        """
        k = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann's constant
        return n * k * t / v
```

When you call **`help`** with the name of a function as an argument, you see its docstring (type `q` to quit Python help).

```
>>> help(pressure)
```

<u>When writing Python programs, include docstrings for all but the simplest functions.</u> Remember, code is written only once, but often read many times. The Python docs include [docstring guidelines](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) that maintain consistency across different Python projects.

**Comments**. Comments in Python can be attached to the end of a line following the `#` symbol. For example, the comment `Boltzmann's constant` above describes `k`. These comments don't ever appear in Python's `help`, and they are ignored by the interpreter. They exist for humans alone.

### 1.4.2 Default Argument Values

A consequence of defining general functions is the introduction of additional arguments. <u>Functions with many arguments can be awkward to call and difficult to read.</u>

In Python, we can provide default values for the arguments of a function. When calling that function, arguments with default values are optional. <u>If they are not provided, then the default value is bound to the formal parameter name instead.</u> For instance, if an application commonly computes pressure for one mole of particles, this value can be provided as a default:

```
>>> def pressure(v, t, n=6.022e23):
        """Compute the pressure in pascals of an ideal gas.

        v -- volume of gas, in cubic meters
        t -- absolute temperature in degrees kelvin
        n -- particles of gas (default: one mole)
        """
        k = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann's constant
        return n * k * t / v
```

The `=` symbol means two different things in this example, depending on the context in which it is used. In the `def` statement header, `=` does not perform assignment, but instead indicates a default value to use when the `pressure` function is called. By contrast, the assignment statement to `k` in the body of the function binds the name `k` to an approximation of Boltzmann's constant.

```
>>> pressure(1, 273.15)
2269.974834
>>> pressure(1, 273.15, 3 * 6.022e23)
6809.924502
```

The `pressure` function is defined to take three arguments, but only two are provided in the first call expression above. In this case, the value for `n` is taken from the `def` statement default. If a third argument is provided, the default is ignored.

<u>As a guideline, most data values used in a function's body should be expressed as default values to named arguments, so that they are easy to inspect and can be changed by the function caller. Some values that never change, such as the fundamental constant `k`, can be bound in the function body or in the global frame.</u>

## 1.5 Control

The expressive power of the functions that we can define at this point is very limited, because we have not introduced a way to make comparisons and to perform different operations depending on the result of a comparison. ***Control statements*** will give us this ability. They are statements that control the flow of a program's execution based on the results of logical comparisons.

Statements differ fundamentally from the expressions that we have studied so far. They have no value. <u>Instead of computing something, executing a control statement determines what the interpreter should do next.</u>

### 1.5.1 Statements

So far, we have primarily considered how to evaluate expressions. However, we have seen three kinds of statements already: assignment, `def`, and `return` statements. These lines of Python code are not themselves expressions, although they all contain expressions as components.

Rather than being evaluated, statements are ***executed***. Each statement describes some change to the interpreter state, and executing a statement applies that change. As we have seen for `return` and assignment statements, executing statements can involve evaluating subexpressions contained within them.

<u>Expressions can also be executed as statements, in which case they are evaluated, but their value is discarded.</u> <u>Executing a pure function has no effect, but executing a non-pure function can cause effects as a consequence of function application.</u>

Consider, for instance,

```
>>> def square(x):
        mul(x, x) # Watch out! This call doesn't return a value.
```

This example is valid Python, but probably not what was intended. The body of the function consists of an expression. <u>An expression by itself is a valid statement, but the effect of the statement is that the `mul` function is called, and the result is discarded.</u> If you want to do something with the result of an expression, you need to say so: you might store it with an assignment statement or return it with a return statement:

```
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x)
```

Sometimes it does make sense to have a function whose body is an expression, when a non-pure function like `print` is called.

```
>>> def print_square(x):
        print(square(x))
```

<u>At its highest level, the Python interpreter's job is to execute programs, composed of statements. However, much of the interesting work of computation comes from evaluating expressions. Statements govern the relationship among different expressions in a program and what happens to their results.</u>

### 1.5.2  Compound Statements

In general, Python code is a sequence of statements. A simple statement is a single line that doesn't end in a colon. A compound statement is so called because it is composed of other statements (simple and compound). **Compound statements** typically span multiple lines and start with a one-line header ending in a colon, which identifies the type of statement. Together, **a header and an indented suite of statements is called a clause**. A compound statement consists of one or more clauses:

```
<header>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
<separating header>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
...
```

We can understand the statements we have already introduced in these terms.

- Expressions, return statements, and assignment statements are simple statements.
- A `def` statement is a compound statement. The suite that follows the `def` header defines the function body.

<u>Specialized evaluation rules for each kind of header dictate when and if the statements in its suite are executed.</u> We say that the <u>header controls its suite.</u> For example, in the case of `def` statements, we saw that the return expression is not evaluated immediately, but instead stored for later use when the defined function is eventually called.

We can also understand multi-line programs now.

- **To execute a sequence of statements, execute the first statement. If that statement does not redirect control, then proceed to execute the rest of the sequence of statements, if any remain.**

This definition exposes the essential structure of a recursively defined *sequence*: <u>a sequence can be decomposed into its first element and the rest of its elements.</u> The "rest" of a sequence of statements is itself a sequence of statements!  Thus, we can recursively apply this execution rule. This view of sequences as recursive data structures will appear again in later chapters.

The important consequence of this rule is that statements are executed in order, but later statements may never be reached, because of redirected control.

**Practical Guidance.** When indenting a suite, all lines must be indented the same amount and in the same way (use spaces, not tabs). Any variation in indentation will cause an error.

### 1.5.3 Defining Functions II: Local Assignment

Originally, we stated that the body of a user-defined function consisted only of a `return` statement with a single return expression. In fact, functions can define a sequence of operations that extends beyond a single expression.

Whenever a user-defined function is applied, the sequence of clauses in the suite of its definition is executed in a **local environment** -- an environment starting with a local frame created by calling that function. A `return` statement redirects control: <u>the process of function application terminates whenever the first `return` statement is executed, and the value of the `return` expression is the returned value of the function being applied.</u>

Assignment statements can appear within a function body. For instance, this function returns the absolute difference between two quantities as a percentage of the first, using a two-step calculation:

![image-20211031105421633](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211031105421633.png)

The effect of an assignment statement is to bind a name to a value in the ***first*** frame of the current environment. As a consequence, assignment statements within a function body cannot affect the global frame. The fact that functions can only manipulate their local environment is critical to creating ***modular*** programs, in which pure functions interact only via the values they take and return.

Of course, the `percent_difference` function could be written as a single expression, as shown below, but the return expression is more complex.

```
>>> def percent_difference(x, y):
        return 100 * abs(x-y) / x
>>> percent_difference(40, 50)
25.0
```

So far, local assignment hasn't increased the expressive power of our function definitions. It will do so, when combined with other control statements. In addition, <u>local assignment also plays a critical role in clarifying the meaning of complex expressions by assigning names to intermediate quantities.</u>

### 1.5.4 Conditional Statements

Python has a built-in function for computing absolute values.

```
>>> abs(-2)
2
```

We would like to be able to implement such a function ourselves, but we have no obvious way to define a function that has a comparison and a choice. We would like to express that if `x` is positive, `abs(x)` returns `x`. Furthermore, if `x` is 0, `abs(x)` returns 0. Otherwise, `abs(x)` returns `-x`. In Python, we can express this choice with a **conditional statement**.

![image-20211031120223291](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211031120223291.png)

This implementation of `absolute_value` raises several important issues:

**Conditional statements**. A conditional statement in Python consists of a series of headers and suites: <u>a required `if` clause, an optional sequence of `elif` clauses, and finally an optional `else` clause:</u>

```
if <expression>:
    <suite>
elif <expression>:
    <suite>
else:
    <suite>
```

When executing a conditional statement, each clause is considered in order. The computational process of executing a conditional clause follows:

1. **Evaluate the header's expression.**
2. **If it is a true value, execute the suite. Then, skip over all subsequent clauses in the conditional statement.**

If the `else` clause is reached (which only happens if all `if` and `elif` expressions evaluate to false values), its suite is executed.

**Boolean contexts**. Above, the execution procedures mention "a false value" and "a true value." The expressions inside the header statements of conditional blocks are said to be in ***boolean contexts***: their truth values matter to control flow, but otherwise their values are not assigned or returned. **Python includes several false values, including 0, `None`, and the *boolean* value `False`. All other numbers are true values.** In Chapter 2, we will see that every built-in kind of data in Python has both true and false values.

**Boolean values**. Python has two boolean values, called `True` and `False`. Boolean values represent truth values in logical expressions. The built-in comparison operations, `>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=`, return these values.

```
>>> 4 < 2
False
>>> 5 >= 5
True
```

This second example reads "5 is greater than or equal to 5", and corresponds to the function `ge` in the `operator` module.

```
>>> 0 == -0
True
```

This final example reads "0 equals -0", and corresponds to `eq` in the `operator` module. Notice that **Python distinguishes assignment (`=`) from equality comparison (`==`)**, a convention shared across many programming languages.

**Boolean operators**. Three basic logical operators are also built into Python:

```
>>> True and False
False
>>> True or False
True
>>> not False
True
```

Logical expressions have corresponding evaluation procedures. <u>These procedures exploit the fact that the truth value of a logical expression can sometimes be determined without evaluating all of its subexpressions, a feature called ***short-circuiting***.</u>

To evaluate the expression `<left> and <right>`:

1. **Evaluate the subexpression `<left>`.**
2. **If the result is a false value `v`, then the expression evaluates to `v`.**
3. **Otherwise, the expression evaluates to the value of the subexpression `<right>`.**

To evaluate the expression `<left> or <right>`:

1. **Evaluate the subexpression `<left>`.**
2. **If the result is a true value `v`, then the expression evaluates to `v`.**
3. **Otherwise, the expression evaluates to the value of the subexpression `<right>`.**

To evaluate the expression `not <exp>`:

1. **Evaluate `<exp>`; The value is `True` if the result is a false value, and `False` otherwise.**

These values, rules, and operators provide us with a way to combine the results of comparisons. <u>Functions that perform comparisons and return boolean values typically begin with `is`, not followed by an underscore</u> (e.g., `isfinite`, `isdigit`, `isinstance`, etc.).

### 1.5.5 Iteration

In addition to selecting which statements to execute, control statements are used to express repetition. If each line of code we wrote were only executed once, programming would be a very unproductive exercise. Only through repeated execution of statements do we unlock the full potential of computers. We have already seen one form of repetition: a function can be applied many times, although it is only defined once. Iterative control structures are another mechanism for executing the same statements many times.

Consider the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, in which each number is the sum of the preceding two:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
```

Each value is constructed by repeatedly applying the sum-previous-two rule. The first and second are fixed to 0 and 1. For instance, the eighth Fibonacci number is 13.

We can use a `while` statement to enumerate `n` Fibonacci numbers. We need to track how many values we've created (`k`), along with the kth value (`curr`) and its predecessor (`pred`). Step through this function and observe how the Fibonacci numbers evolve one by one, bound to `curr`.

![image-20211031194509432](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211031194509432.png)

Remember that commas separate multiple names and values in an assignment statement. The line:

```
pred, curr = curr, pred + curr
```

has the effect of rebinding the name `pred` to the value of `curr`, and simultaneously rebinding `curr` to the value of `pred + curr`. All of the expressions to the right of `=` are evaluated before any rebinding takes place.

This order of events -- evaluating everything on the right of `=` before updating any bindings on the left -- is essential for correctness of this function.

A `while` clause contains a header expression followed by a suite:

```
while <expression>:
    <suite>
```

To execute a `while` clause:

1. **Evaluate the header's expression.**
2. **If it is a true value, execute the suite, then return to step 1.**

In step 2, the entire suite of the `while` clause is executed before the header expression is evaluated again.

In order to prevent the suite of a `while` clause from being executed indefinitely, the suite should always change some binding in each pass.

A `while` statement that does not terminate is called an infinite loop. Press `<Control>-C` to force Python to stop looping.

### 1.5.6 Testing

*Testing* a function is the act of verifying that the function's behavior matches expectations. Our language of functions is now sufficiently complex that we need to start testing our implementations.

A ***test*** is a mechanism for systematically performing this verification. Tests typically take the form of another function that contains one or more sample calls to the function being tested. The returned value is then verified against an expected result. Unlike most functions, which are meant to be general, tests involve selecting and validating calls with specific argument values. Tests also serve as documentation: they demonstrate how to call a function and what argument values are appropriate.

**Assertions.** Programmers use `assert` statements to verify expectations, such as the output of a function being tested. **An `assert` statement has an expression in a boolean context, followed by a quoted line of text (single or double quotes are both fine, but be consistent) that will be displayed if the expression evaluates to a false value.**

```
>>> assert fib(8) == 13, 'The 8th Fibonacci number should be 13'
```

When the expression being asserted evaluates to a true value, executing an assert statement has no effect. When it is a false value, `assert` causes an error that halts execution.

A test function for `fib` should test several arguments, including extreme values of `n`.

```
>>> def fib_test():
        assert fib(2) == 1, 'The 2nd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(3) == 1, 'The 3rd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(50) == 7778742049, 'Error at the 50th Fibonacci number'
```

**When writing Python in files, rather than directly into the interpreter, tests are typically written in the same file or a neighboring file with the suffix `_test.py`.**

**Doctests.** Python provides a convenient method for placing simple tests directly in the docstring of a function. The first line of a docstring should contain a one-line description of the function, followed by a blank line. A detailed description of arguments and behavior may follow. In addition, the docstring may include a sample interactive session that calls the function:

```
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        """Return the sum of the first n natural numbers.

        >>> sum_naturals(10)
        55
        >>> sum_naturals(100)
        5050
        """
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return total
```

Then, the interaction can be verified via the [doctest module](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/doctest.html). 

```
>>> from doctest import testmod
>>> testmod()
TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
```

To verify the doctest interactions for only a single function, we use a `doctest` function called `run_docstring_examples`. This function is (unfortunately) a bit complicated to call. Its first argument is the function to test. The second should always be the result of the expression `globals()`, a built-in function that returns the global environment. The third argument is `True` to indicate that we would like "verbose" output: a catalog of all tests run.

Below, the `globals` function returns a representation of the global environment, which the interpreter needs in order to evaluate expressions.

```
>>> from doctest import run_docstring_examples
>>> run_docstring_examples(sum_naturals, globals(), True)
Finding tests in NoName
Trying:
    sum_naturals(10)
Expecting:
    55
ok
Trying:
    sum_naturals(100)
Expecting:
    5050
ok
```

When the return value of a function does not match the expected result, the `run_docstring_examples` function will report this problem as a test failure.

When writing Python in files, all doctests in a file can be run by starting Python with the doctest command line option:

```
python3 -m doctest <python_source_file>
```

**The key to effective testing is to write (and run) tests immediately after implementing new functions. It is even good practice to write some tests before you implement, in order to have some example inputs and outputs in your mind.** A test that applies a single function is called a ***unit test***. Exhaustive unit testing is a hallmark of good program design.

## 1.6 Higher-Order Functions

We have seen that functions are a method of abstraction that describe compound operations independent of the particular values of their arguments. That is, in `square`,

```
>>> def square(x):
        return x * x
```

we are not talking about the square of a particular number, but rather about a method for obtaining the square of any number. Of course, we could get along without ever defining this function, by always writing expressions such as

```
>>> 3 * 3
9
>>> 5 * 5
25
```

and never mentioning `square` explicitly. This practice would suffice for simple computations such as `square`, but would become arduous for more complex examples such as `abs` or `fib`. In general, lacking function definition would put us at the disadvantage of forcing us to work always at the level of the particular operations that happen to be primitives in the language (multiplication, in this case) rather than in terms of higher-level operations. Our programs would be able to compute squares, but our language would lack the ability to express the concept of squaring.

**One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the names directly.**  Functions provide this ability. As we will see in the following examples, there are common programming patterns that recur in code, but are used with a number of different functions. These patterns can also be abstracted, by giving them names.

To express certain general patterns as named concepts, we will need to construct functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as values. **Functions that manipulate functions are called higher-order functions.** This section shows how higher-order functions can serve as powerful abstraction mechanisms, vastly increasing the expressive power of our language.

### 1.6.1 Functions as Arguments

Consider the following three functions, which all compute summations. The first, `sum_naturals`, computes the sum of natural numbers up to `n`:

```
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return total
>>> sum_naturals(100)
5050
```

The second, `sum_cubes`, computes the sum of the cubes of natural numbers up to `n`.

```
>>> def sum_cubes(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k*k*k, k + 1
        return total
>>> sum_cubes(100)
25502500
```

The third, `pi_sum`, computes the sum of terms in the series

![image-20211105145757822](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211105145757822.png)

which converges to pi very slowly.

```
>>> def pi_sum(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + 8 / ((4*k-3) * (4*k-1)), k + 1
        return total
>>> pi_sum(100)
3.1365926848388144
```

These three functions clearly share a common underlying pattern. They are for the most part identical, differing only in name and the function of `k` used to compute the term to be added. We could generate each of the functions by filling in slots in the same template:

```
def <name>(n):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + <term>(k), k + 1
    return total
```

The presence of such a common pattern is strong evidence that there is a useful abstraction waiting to be brought to the surface. Each of these functions is a summation of terms. As program designers, we would like our language to be powerful enough so that we can write a function that expresses the concept of summation itself rather than only functions that compute particular sums. We can do so readily in Python by taking the common template shown above and transforming the "slots" into formal parameters:

In the example below, `summation` takes as its two arguments the upper bound `n` together with the function `term` that computes the kth term. We can use `summation` just as we would any function, and it expresses summations succinctly. Take the time to step through this example, and notice how binding `cube` to the local names `term` ensures that the result `1*1*1 + 2*2*2 + 3*3*3 = 36` is computed correctly. In this example, frames which are no longer needed are removed to save space.

```python
def summation(n, term):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + term(k), k + 1
    return total

def cube(x):
    return x*x*x

def sum_cubes(n):
    return summation(n, cube)

result = sum_cubes(3)
```

![image-20211105150933502](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211105150933502.png)

Using an `identity` function that returns its argument, we can also sum natural numbers using exactly the same `summation` function.

```
>>> def summation(n, term):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + term(k), k + 1
        return total
>>> def identity(x):
        return x
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        return summation(n, identity)
>>> sum_naturals(10)
55
```

The `summation` function can also be called directly, without defining another function for a specific sequence.

```
>>> summation(10, square)
385
```

We can define `pi_sum` using our `summation` abstraction by defining a function `pi_term` to compute each term. We pass the argument `1e6`, a shorthand for `1 * 10^6 = 1000000`, to generate a close approximation to pi.

```
>>> def pi_term(x):
        return 8 / ((4*x-3) * (4*x-1))
>>> def pi_sum(n):
        return summation(n, pi_term)
>>> pi_sum(1e6)
3.141592153589902
```

### 1.6.2  Functions as General Methods

We introduced user-defined functions as a mechanism for abstracting patterns of numerical operations so as to make them independent of the particular numbers involved. With higher-order functions, we begin to see a more powerful kind of abstraction: **some functions express general methods of computation, independent of the particular functions they call.**

Despite this conceptual extension of what a function means, our environment model of how to evaluate a call expression extends gracefully to the case of higher-order functions, without change. When a user-defined function is applied to some arguments, the formal parameters are bound to the values of those arguments (which may be functions) in a new local frame.

Consider the following example, which implements a general method for iterative improvement and uses it to compute the [golden ratio](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~demo5337/s97b/art.htm). The golden ratio, often called "phi", is a number near 1.6 that appears frequently in nature, art, and architecture.

An iterative improvement algorithm begins with a `guess` of a solution to an equation. It repeatedly applies an `update` function to improve that guess, and applies a `close` comparison to check whether the current `guess` is "close enough" to be considered correct.

```
>>> def improve(update, close, guess=1):
        while not close(guess):
            guess = update(guess)
        return guess
```

This `improve` function is a general expression of repetitive refinement. It doesn't specify what problem is being solved: those details are left to the `update` and `close` functions passed in as arguments.

Among the well-known properties of the golden ratio are that it can be computed by repeatedly summing the inverse of any positive number with 1, and that it is one less than its square. We can express these properties as functions to be used with `improve`.

```
>>> def golden_update(guess):
        return 1/guess + 1
>>> def square_close_to_successor(guess):
        return approx_eq(guess * guess, guess + 1)
```

Above, we introduce a call to `approx_eq` that is meant to return `True` if its arguments are approximately equal to each other. To implement, `approx_eq`, we can compare the absolute value of the difference between two numbers to a small tolerance value.

```
>>> def approx_eq(x, y, tolerance=1e-15):
        return abs(x - y) < tolerance
```

Calling `improve` with the arguments `golden_update` and `square_close_to_successor` will compute a finite approximation to the golden ratio.

```
>>> improve(golden_update, square_close_to_successor)
1.6180339887498951
```

By tracing through the steps of evaluation, we can see how this result is computed. First, a local frame for `improve` is constructed with bindings for `update`, `close`, and `guess`. In the body of `improve`, the name `close` is bound to `square_close_to_successor`, which is called on the initial value of `guess`. Trace through the rest of the steps to see the computational process that evolves to compute the golden ratio.

![image-20211105153302267](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211105153302267.png)

This example illustrates two related big ideas in computer science. First, **naming and functions allow us to abstract away a vast amount of complexity**. While each function definition has been trivial, the computational process set in motion by our evaluation procedure is quite intricate. Second, **it is only by virtue of the fact that we have an extremely general evaluation procedure for the Python language that small components can be composed into complex processes.** Understanding the procedure of interpreting programs allows us to validate and inspect the process we have created.

As always, our new general method `improve` needs a test to check its correctness. The golden ratio can provide such a test, because it also has an exact closed-form solution, which we can compare to this iterative result.

```
>>> from math import sqrt
>>> phi = 1/2 + sqrt(5)/2
>>> def improve_test():
        approx_phi = improve(golden_update, square_close_to_successor)
        assert approx_eq(phi, approx_phi), 'phi differs from its approximation'
>>> improve_test()
```

**For this test, no news is good news**: `improve_test` returns `None` after its `assert` statement is executed successfully.

### 1.6.3 Defining Functions III: Nested Definitions

The above examples demonstrate how the ability to pass functions as arguments significantly enhances the expressive power of our programming language. Each general concept or equation maps onto its own short function. **One negative consequence of this approach is that the global frame becomes cluttered with names of small functions, which must all be unique. Another problem is that we are constrained by particular function signatures: the `update` argument to `improve` must take exactly one argument.** **Nested function definitions** address both of these problems, but require us to enrich our environment model.

Let's consider a new problem: computing the square root of a number. In programming languages, "square root" is often abbreviated as `sqrt`. Repeated application of the following update converges to the square root of `a`:

```
>>> def average(x, y):
        return (x + y)/2
>>> def sqrt_update(x, a):
        return average(x, a/x)
```

This two-argument update function is incompatible with `improve` (it takes two arguments, not one), and it provides only a single update, while we really care about taking square roots by repeated updates. The solution to both of these issues is to place function definitions inside the body of other definitions.

```
>>> def sqrt(a):
        def sqrt_update(x):
            return average(x, a/x)
        def sqrt_close(x):
            return approx_eq(x * x, a)
        return improve(sqrt_update, sqrt_close)
```

**Like local assignment, local `def` statements only affect the current local frame.** These functions are only in scope while `sqrt` is being evaluated. Consistent with our evaluation procedure, these local `def` statements don't even get evaluated until `sqrt` is called.

**Lexical scope.** **Locally defined functions also have access to the name bindings in the scope in which they are defined**. In this example, `sqrt_update` refers to the name `a`, which is a formal parameter of its enclosing function `sqrt`. This discipline of sharing names among nested definitions is called ***lexical scoping***. Critically, the inner functions have access to the names in the environment where they are defined **(not where they are called)**.

We require two extensions to our environment model to enable lexical scoping.

1. **Each user-defined function has a parent environment: the environment in which it was defined.**
2. **When a user-defined function is called, its local frame extends its parent environment.**

Previous to `sqrt`, all functions were defined in the global environment, and so they all had the same parent: the global environment. By contrast, when Python evaluates the first two clauses of `sqrt`, it create functions that are associated with a local environment. In the call

```
>>> sqrt(256)
16.0
```

the environment first adds a local frame for `sqrt` and evaluates the `def` statements for `sqrt_update` and `sqrt_close`.

![image-20211105200436534](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211105200436534.png)

Function values each have a new annotation that we will include in environment diagrams from now on, a ***parent***. **The parent of a function value is the first frame of the environment in which that function was defined.** Functions without parent annotations were defined in the global environment. **When a user-defined function is called, the frame created has the same parent as that function.**

Subsequently, the name `sqrt_update` resolves to this newly defined function, which is passed as an argument to `improve`. Within the body of `improve`, we must apply our `update` function (bound to `sqrt_update`) to the initial guess `x` of 1. This final application creates an environment for `sqrt_update` that begins with a local frame containing only `x`, but with the parent frame `sqrt` still containing a binding for `a`.

![image-20211106092930237](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211106092930237.png)

The most critical part of this evaluation procedure is the transfer of the parent for `sqrt_update` to the frame created by calling `sqrt_update`. This frame is also annotated with `[parent=f1]`.

**Extended Environments**. An environment can consist of an arbitrarily long chain of frames, which always concludes with the global frame. Previous to this `sqrt` example, environments had at most two frames: a local frame and the global frame. By calling functions that were defined within other functions, via nested `def` statements, we can create longer chains. The environment for this call to `sqrt_update` consists of three frames: the local `sqrt_update` frame, the `sqrt` frame in which `sqrt_update` was defined (labeled `f1`), and the global frame.

The return expression in the body of `sqrt_update` can resolve a value for `a` by following this chain of frames. **Looking up a name finds the first value bound to that name in the current environment.** Python checks first in the `sqrt_update` frame -- no `a` exists. Python checks next in the parent frame, `f1`, and finds a binding for `a` to 256.

Hence, we realize two key advantages of lexical scoping in Python.

- **The names of a local function do not interfere with names external to the function in which it is defined, because the local function name will be bound in the current local environment in which it was defined, rather than the global environment.**
- A local function can access the environment of the enclosing function, because the body of the local function is evaluated in an environment that extends the evaluation environment in which it was defined.

The `sqrt_update` function carries with it some data: the value for `a` referenced in the environment in which it was defined. Because they "enclose" information in this way, locally defined functions are often called ***closures***.

> The inner def is going to have the frame of the outer def 's function call as its parent.

### 1.6.4 Functions as Returned Values

We can achieve even more expressive power in our programs by creating functions whose returned values are themselves functions. An important feature of lexically scoped programming languages is that locally defined functions maintain their parent environment when they are returned. The following example illustrates the utility of this feature.

Once many simple functions are defined, function ***composition*** is a natural method of combination to include in our programming language. That is, given two functions `f(x)` and `g(x)`, we might want to define `h(x) = f(g(x))`. We can define function composition using our existing tools:

```
>>> def compose1(f, g):
        def h(x):
            return f(g(x))
        return h
```

The environment diagram for this example shows how the names `f` and `g` are resolved correctly, even in the presence of conflicting names.

![image-20211106100744764](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211106100744764.png)

The 1 in `compose1` is meant to signify that the composed functions all take a single argument. This naming convention is not enforced by the interpreter; the 1 is just part of the function name.

At this point, we begin to observe the benefits of our effort to define precisely the environment model of computation. No modification to our environment model is required to explain our ability to return functions in this way.

### 1.6.5 Example: Newton's Method

This extended example shows how function return values and local definitions can work together to express general ideas concisely. We will implement an algorithm that is used broadly in machine learning, scientific computing, hardware design, and optimization.

Newton's method is a classic iterative approach to finding the arguments of a mathematical function that yield a return value of 0. These values are called the ***zeros*** of the function. Finding a zero of a function is often equivalent to solving some other problem of interest, such as computing a square root.

A motivating comment before we proceed: it is easy to take for granted the fact that we know how to compute square roots. Not just Python, but your phone, web browser, or pocket calculator can do so for you. However, part of learning computer science is understanding how quantities like these can be computed, and the general approach presented here is applicable to solving a large class of equations beyond those built into Python.

Newton's method is an iterative improvement algorithm: it improves a guess of the zero for any function that is ***differentiable***, which means that it can be approximated by a straight line at any point. Newton's method follows these linear approximations to find function zeros.

Imagine a line through the point $(x,f(x))$ that has the same slope as the curve for function $f(x)$ at that point. Such a line is called the ***tangent***, and its slope is called the ***derivative*** of $f$ at $x$.

This line's slope is the ratio of the change in function value to the change in function argument. Hence, translating $x$  by $f(x)$ divided by the slope will give the argument value at which this tangent line touches 0.

![image-20211106125647112](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211106125647112.png)

A `newton_update` expresses the computational process of following this tangent line to 0, for a function `f` and its derivative `df`.

```
>>> def newton_update(f, df):
        def update(x):
            return x - f(x) / df(x)
        return update
```

Finally, we can define the `find_root` function in terms of `newton_update`, our `improve` algorithm, and a comparison to see if $f(x)$ is near 0.

```
>>> def find_zero(f, df):
        def near_zero(x):
            return approx_eq(f(x), 0)
        return improve(newton_update(f, df), near_zero)
```

**Computing Roots.** Using Newton's method, we can compute roots of arbitrary degree $n$. The degree $n$ root of $a$ is $x$ such that $x \cdot x \cdot x \dots x = a$ with $x$ repeated $n$ times. For example,

- The square (second) root of 64 is 8, because $8 \cdot 8 = 64$.
- The cube (third) root of 64 is 4, because $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$.
- The sixth root of 64 is 2, because $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 64$.

We can compute roots using Newton's method with the following observations:

- The square root of 64 (written $\sqrt{64}$) is the value x such that $x^2 - 64 = 0$
- More generally, the degree n root of a (written $\sqrt[n]{a}$) is the value x such that $x^n - a = 0$

If we can find a zero of this last equation, then we can compute degree $n$ roots. By plotting the curves for n equal to 2, 3, and 6 and $a$ equal to 64, we can visualize this relationship.

![image-20211107105254403](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211107105254403.png)

We first implement `square_root` by defining `f` and its derivative `df`. We use from calculus the fact that the derivative of $f(x) = x^2 - a$ is the linear function $df(x) = 2x$.

```
>>> def square_root_newton(a):
        def f(x):
            return x * x - a
        def df(x):
            return 2 * x
        return find_zero(f, df)
>>> square_root_newton(64)
8.0
```

Generalizing to roots of arbitrary degree n, we compute $f(x) = x^n - a$ and its derivative $df(x) = n \cdot x^{n-1}$.

```
>>> def power(x, n):
        """Return x * x * x * ... * x for x repeated n times."""
        product, k = 1, 0
        while k < n:
            product, k = product * x, k + 1
        return product
>>> def nth_root_of_a(n, a):
        def f(x):
            return power(x, n) - a
        def df(x):
            return n * power(x, n-1)
        return find_zero(f, df)
>>> nth_root_of_a(2, 64)
8.0
>>> nth_root_of_a(3, 64)
4.0
>>> nth_root_of_a(6, 64)
2.0
```

The approximation error in all of these computations can be reduced by changing the `tolerance` in `approx_eq` to a smaller number.

As you experiment with Newton's method, be aware that it will not always converge. The initial guess of `improve` must be sufficiently close to the zero, and various conditions about the function must be met. Despite this shortcoming, Newton's method is a powerful general computational method for solving differentiable equations. Very fast algorithms for logarithms and large integer division employ variants of the technique in modern computers.

### 1.6.6 Currying

We can use higher-order functions to convert a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument. More specifically, given a function `f(x, y)`, we can define a function `g` such that `g(x)(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`. Here, `g` is a higher-order function that takes in a single argument `x` and returns another function that takes in a single argument `y`. This transformation is called ***currying***.

As an example, we can define a curried version of the `pow` function:

```
>>> def curried_pow(x):
        def h(y):
            return pow(x, y)
        return h
>>> curried_pow(2)(3)
8
```

Some programming languages, such as Haskell, only allow functions that take a single argument, so the programmer must curry all multi-argument procedures. In more general languages such as Python, currying is useful when we require a function that takes in only a single argument. For example, the ***map*** pattern applies a single-argument function to a sequence of values. In later chapters, we will see more general examples of the map pattern, but for now, we can implement the pattern in a function:

```
>>> def map_to_range(start, end, f):
        while start < end:
            print(f(start))
            start = start + 1
```

We can use `map_to_range` and `curried_pow` to compute the first ten powers of two, rather than specifically writing a function to do so:

```
>>> map_to_range(0, 10, curried_pow(2))
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
256
512
```

We can similarly use the same two functions to compute powers of other numbers. Currying allows us to do so without writing a specific function for each number whose powers we wish to compute.

In the above examples, we manually performed the currying transformation on the `pow` function to obtain `curried_pow`. Instead, we can define functions to automate currying, as well as the inverse ***uncurrying*** transformation:

```
>>> def curry2(f):
        """Return a curried version of the given two-argument function."""
        def g(x):
            def h(y):
                return f(x, y)
            return h
        return g
>>> def uncurry2(g):
        """Return a two-argument version of the given curried function."""
        def f(x, y):
            return g(x)(y)
        return f
>>> pow_curried = curry2(pow)
>>> pow_curried(2)(5)
32
>>> map_to_range(0, 10, pow_curried(2))
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
256
512
```

The `curry2` function takes in a two-argument function `f` and returns a single-argument function `g`. When `g` is applied to an argument `x`, it returns a single-argument function `h`. When `h` is applied to `y`, it calls `f(x, y)`. Thus, `curry2(f)(x)(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`. The `uncurry2` function reverses the currying transformation, so that `uncurry2(curry2(f))` is equivalent to `f`.

```
>>> uncurry2(pow_curried)(2, 5)
32
```

### 1.6.7 Lambda Expressions

So far, each time we have wanted to define a new function, we needed to give it a name. But for other types of expressions, we don't need to associate intermediate values with a name. That is, we can compute `a*b + c*d` without having to name the subexpressions `a*b` or `c*d`, or the full expression. In Python, we can create function values on the fly using `lambda` expressions, which evaluate to unnamed functions. **A lambda expression evaluates to a function that has a single return expression as its body. Assignment and control statements are not allowed.**

> on the fly: 
>
> In relation to computer technology, "on the fly" describes activities that develop or occur dynamically rather than as the result of  something that is statically predefined. For example, the content of a [page](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/page) that is sent to you from a [Web site](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Web-site) can be developed (and varied) "on the fly" based on dynamic factors  such as the time of day, what pages the user has looked at previously,  and specific user input. The Web server calls an application program to  produce the "on-the-fly" page that is to be returned. There are several  techniques for on-the-fly page development, including the server-side  include , the use of [cookie](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/cookie) (information previously stored about you that is located in a special  file on your hard disk), and Microsoft's Active Server Page .
>
> In general usage, the expression often connotes a degree of haste and improvisation as in "I usually grab breakfast on the fly." This usage  is somewhat similar to the expression "catch as catch can." The term  also can simply connote being in a mobile or fluid situation. Our *Webster's New World Dictionary* reminds us that the term probably originated with bird hunting and  shooting birds on the fly (rather than on the ground). The dictionary  says simply ""in flight" and adds a colloquial meaning of "in a hurry."

```
>>> def compose1(f, g):
        return lambda x: f(g(x))
```

We can understand the structure of a `lambda` expression by constructing a corresponding English sentence:

```
     lambda            x            :          f(g(x))
"A function that    takes x    and returns     f(g(x))"
```

The result of a lambda expression is called a lambda function. It has no intrinsic name (and so Python prints `<lambda>` for the name), but otherwise it behaves like any other function.

```
>>> s = lambda x: x * x
>>> s
<function <lambda> at 0xf3f490>
>>> s(12)
144
```

In an environment diagram, the result of a lambda expression is a function as well, named with the Greek letter λ (lambda). Our compose example can be expressed quite compactly with lambda expressions.

![image-20211107121343612](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211107121343612.png)

Some programmers find that using unnamed functions from lambda expressions to be shorter and more direct. However, compound `lambda` expressions are notoriously illegible, despite their brevity. The following definition is correct, but many programmers have trouble understanding it quickly.

```
>>> compose1 = lambda f,g: lambda x: f(g(x))
```

**In general, Python style prefers explicit `def` statements to lambda expressions, but allows them in cases where a simple function is needed as an argument or return value.**

Such stylistic rules are merely guidelines; you can program any way you wish. However, as you write programs, think about the audience of people who might read your program one day. When you can make your program easier to understand, you do those people a favor.

The term ***lambda*** is a historical accident resulting from the incompatibility of written mathematical notation and the constraints of early type-setting systems.

> It may seem perverse to use lambda to introduce a procedure/function. The notation goes back to Alonzo Church, who in the 1930's started with a "hat" symbol; he wrote the square function as "ŷ . y × y". But frustrated typographers moved the hat to the left of the parameter and changed it to a capital lambda: "Λy . y × y"; from there the capital lambda was changed to lowercase, and now we see "λy . y × y" in math books and `(lambda (y) (* y y))` in Lisp.

> ​                                                                                                                                 —Peter Norvig (norvig.com/lispy2.html)

Despite their unusual etymology, `lambda` expressions and the corresponding formal language for function application, the ***lambda calculus***, are fundamental computer science concepts shared far beyond the Python programming community. We will revisit this topic when we study the design of interpreters in Chapter 3.

### 1.6.8 Abstractions and First-Class Functions

We began this section with the observation that **user-defined functions are a crucial abstraction mechanism, because they permit us to express general methods of computing as explicit elements in our programming language.** Now we've seen how higher-order functions permit us to manipulate these general methods to create further abstractions.

**As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the underlying abstractions in our programs, build upon them, and generalize them to create more powerful abstractions.** <u>This is not to say that one should always write programs in the most abstract way possible; expert programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task.</u> But it is important to be able to think in terms of these abstractions, so that we can be ready to apply them in new contexts. **The significance of higher-order functions is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements.**

In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have **first-class status**. Some of the "rights and privileges" of first-class elements are:

1. **They may be bound to names.**
2. **They may be passed as arguments to functions.**
3. **They may be returned as the results of functions.**
4. **They may be included in data structures.**

Python awards functions full first-class status, and the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.

> The Purpose of Higher-Order Functions 
>
> Functions are first-class: Functions can be manipulated as values in our programming language.
>
> Higher-order function: A function that takes a function as an argument value or returns a function as a return value 
>
> Higher-order functions:
>
> - Express general methods of computation
> - Remove repetition from programs
> - Separate concerns among functions

### 1.6.9 Function Decorators

Python provides special syntax to apply higher-order functions as part of executing a `def` statement, called a **decorator**. Perhaps the most common example is a **trace**.

```
>>> def trace(fn):
        def wrapped(x):
            print('-> ', fn, '(', x, ')')
            return fn(x)
        return wrapped
>>> @trace
    def triple(x):
        return 3 * x
>>> triple(12)
->  <function triple at 0x102a39848> ( 12 )
36
```

In this example, A higher-order function `trace` is defined, which returns a function that precedes a call to its argument with a `print` statement that outputs the argument. The `def` statement for `triple` has an annotation, `@trace`, which affects the execution rule for `def`. As usual, the function `triple` is created. However, the name `triple` is not bound to this function. Instead, **the name `triple` is bound to the returned function value of calling `trace` on the newly defined `triple` function**. In code, this decorator is equivalent to:

```
>>> def triple(x):
        return 3 * x
>>> triple = trace(triple)
```

In the projects associated with this text, decorators are used for tracing, as well as selecting which functions to call when a program is run from the command line.

**Extra for experts.** The decorator symbol `@` may also be followed by a call expression. The expression following `@` is evaluated first (just as the name `trace` was evaluated above), the `def` statement second, and finally the result of evaluating the decorator expression is applied to the newly defined function, and the result is bound to the name in the `def` statement. A [short tutorial on decorators](http://programmingbits.pythonblogs.com/27_programmingbits/archive/50_function_decorators.html) by Ariel Ortiz gives further examples for interested students.

```python
# Fall 2018 Midterm 1 Question 6A: repeat & detector
    def repeat(k):
    """When called repeatedly, print each repeated argument.
    
    >>> f = repeat(1)(7)(7)(3)(4)(2)(5)(1)(6)(5)(1)
    7
    1
    5
    1
    """
    return detector(lambda j: False)(k)

def detector(have_seen):
    def g(i):
        if have_seen(i):
            print(i)
        return detector(lambda j: j == i or have_seen(j))
    return g

pumbaa(pumbaa)(*) = pumba(pumba(*))

## 1.7 Recursive Functions

A function is called ***recursive*** if the body of the function calls the function itself, either directly or indirectly. That is, the process of executing the body of a recursive function may in turn require applying that function again. Recursive functions do not use any special syntax in Python, but they do require some effort to understand and create.

We'll begin with an example problem: write a function that sums the digits of a natural number. When designing recursive functions, we look for ways in which a problem can be broken down into simpler problems. In this case, the operators `%` and `//` can be used to separate a number into two parts: its last digit and all but its last digit.

```
>>> 18117 % 10
7
>>> 18117 // 10
1811
```

The sum of the digits of 18117 is `1+8+1+1+7 = 18`. Just as we can separate the number, we can separate this sum into the last digit, 7, and the sum of all but the last digit, `1+8+1+1 = 11`. This separation gives us an algorithm: to sum the digits of a number `n`, add its last digit `n % 10` to the sum of the digits of `n // 10`. There's one special case: if a number has only one digit, then the sum of its digits is itself. This algorithm can be implemented as a recursive function.

```
>>> def sum_digits(n):
        """Return the sum of the digits of positive integer n."""
        if n < 10:
            return n
        else:
            all_but_last, last = n // 10, n % 10
            return sum_digits(all_but_last) + last
```

This definition of `sum_digits` is both complete and correct, even though the `sum_digits` function is called within its own body. The problem of summing the digits of a number is broken down into two steps: summing all but the last digit, then adding the last digit. Both of these steps are simpler than the original problem. The function is recursive because the first step is the same kind of problem as the original problem. That is, `sum_digits` is exactly the function we need in order to implement `sum_digits`.

```
>>> sum_digits(9)
9
>>> sum_digits(18117)
18
>>> sum_digits(9437184)
36
>>> sum_digits(11408855402054064613470328848384)
126
```

We can understand precisely how this recursive function applies successfully using our environment model of computation. No new rules are required.

![image-20211115131016596](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211115131016596.png)

When the `def` statement is executed, the name `sum_digits` is bound to a new function, but the body of that function is not yet executed. Therefore, the circular nature of `sum_digits` is not a problem yet. Then, `sum_digits` is called on 738:

1. A local frame for `sum_digits` with `n` bound to 738 is created, and the body of `sum_digits` is executed in the environment that starts with that frame.
2. Since 738 is not less than 10, the assignment statement on line 4 is executed, splitting 738 into 73 and 8.
3. In the following return statement, `sum_digits` is called on 73, the value of `all_but_last` in the current environment.
4. Another local frame for `sum_digits` is created, this time with `n` bound to 73. The body of `sum_digits` is again executed in the new environment that starts with this frame.
5. Since 73 is also not less than 10, 73 is split into 7 and 3 and `sum_digits` is called on 7, the value of `all_but_last` evaluated in this frame.
6. A third local frame for `sum_digits` is created, with `n` bound to 7.
7. In the environment starting with this frame, it is true that `n < 10`, and therefore 7 is returned.
8. In the second local frame, this return value 7 is summed with 3, the value of `last`, to return 10.
9. In the first local frame, this return value 10 is summed with 8, the value of `last`, to return 18.

This recursive function applies correctly, despite its circular character, because it is applied twice, but with a different argument each time. Moreover, the second application was a simpler instance of the digit summing problem than the first. Generate the environment diagram for the call `sum_digits(18117)` to see that each successive call to `sum_digits` takes a smaller argument than the last, until eventually a single-digit input is reached.

This example also illustrates how functions with simple bodies can evolve complex computational processes by using recursion.

### 1.7.1 The Anatomy of Recursive Functions

A common pattern can be found in the body of many recursive functions. The body begins with a ***base case***, a conditional statement that defines the behavior of the function for the inputs that are simplest to process. In the case of `sum_digits`, the base case is any single-digit argument, and we simply return that argument. Some recursive functions will have multiple base cases.

The base cases are then followed by one or more ***recursive calls***. Recursive calls always have a certain character: they simplify the original problem. Recursive functions express computation by simplifying problems incrementally. For example, summing the digits of 7 is simpler than summing the digits of 73, which in turn is simpler than summing the digits of 738. For each subsequent call, there is less work left to be done.

Recursive functions often solve problems in a different way than the iterative approaches that we have used previously. Consider a function `fact` to compute `n` factorial, where for example `fact(4)` computes $4! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$.

A natural implementation using a `while` statement accumulates the total by multiplying together each positive integer up to `n`.

```
>>> def fact_iter(n):
        total, k = 1, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total * k, k + 1
        return total
>>> fact_iter(4)
24
```

On the other hand, a recursive implementation of factorial can express `fact(n)` in terms of `fact(n-1)`, a simpler problem. The base case of the recursion is the simplest form of the problem: `fact(1)` is 1.

![image-20211115132904410](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211115132904410.png)

These two factorial functions differ conceptually. The iterative function constructs the result from the base case of 1 to the final total by successively multiplying in each term. The recursive function, on the other hand, constructs the result directly from the final term, `n`,  and the result of the simpler problem, `fact(n-1)`.

As the recursion "unwinds" through successive applications of the *fact* function to simpler and simpler problem instances, the result is eventually built starting from the base case. The recursion ends by passing the argument 1 to `fact`; the result of each call depends on the next until the base case is reached.

The correctness of this recursive function is easy to verify from the standard definition of the mathematical function for factorial:
$$
\begin{align*} (n-1)! &=     (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \dots \cdot 1 \\ n!     &= n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \dots \cdot 1 \\ n!     &= n \cdot (n-1)! \end{align*}
$$
While we can unwind the recursion using our model of computation, it is often clearer to think about recursive calls as functional abstractions. That is, we should not care about how `fact(n-1)` is implemented in the body of `fact`; we should simply trust that it computes the factorial of `n-1`. Treating a recursive call as a functional abstraction has been called a ***recursive leap of faith***. We define a function in terms of itself, but simply trust that the simpler cases will work correctly when verifying the correctness of the function. In this example, we trust that `fact(n-1)` will correctly compute `(n-1)!`; we must only check that `n!` is computed correctly if this assumption holds. In this way, verifying the correctness of a recursive function is a form of proof by induction.

The functions *fact_iter* and *fact* also differ because the former must introduce two additional names, `total` and `k`, that are not required in the recursive implementation. In general, iterative functions must maintain some local state that changes throughout the course of computation. At any point in the iteration, that state characterizes the result of completed work and the amount of work remaining. For example, when `k` is 3 and total is 2, there are still two terms remaining to be processed, 3 and 4. On the other hand, *fact* is characterized by its single argument `n`. The state of the computation is entirely contained within the structure of the environment, which has return values that take the role of `total`, and binds `n` to different values in different frames rather than explicitly tracking `k`.

Recursive functions leverage the rules of evaluating call expressions to bind names to values, often avoiding the nuisance of correctly assigning local names during iteration. For this reason, recursive functions can be easier to define correctly. However, learning to recognize the computational processes evolved by recursive functions certainly requires practice.

### 1.7.2 Mutual Recursion

When a recursive procedure is divided among two functions that call each other, the functions are said to be *mutually recursive*. As an example, consider the following definition of even and odd for non-negative integers:

- a number is even if it is one more than an odd number
- a number is odd if it is one more than an even number
- 0 is even

Using this definition, we can implement mutually recursive functions to determine whether a number is even or odd:

```
def is_even(n):
    if n == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return is_odd(n-1)

def is_odd(n):
    if n == 0:
        return False
    else:
        return is_even(n-1)

result = is_even(4)
```

![image-20211115203657935](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211115203657935.png)

Mutually recursive functions can be turned into a single recursive function by breaking the abstraction boundary between the two functions. In this example, the body of `is_odd` can be incorporated into that of `is_even`, making sure to replace `n` with `n-1` in the body of `is_odd` to reflect the argument passed into it:

```
def is_even(n):
	if n == 0:
		return True
	else:
		if (n-1) == 0:
			return False
		else:
			return is_even((n-1)-1)
```

As such, mutual recursion is no more mysterious or powerful than simple recursion, and it provides a mechanism for maintaining abstraction within a complicated recursive program.

### 1.7.3 Printing in Recursive Functions

The computational process evolved by a recursive function can often be visualized using calls to `print`. As an example, we will implement a function `cascade` that prints all prefixes of a number from largest to smallest to largest.

```python
>>> def cascade(n):
        """Print a cascade of prefixes of n."""
        if n < 10:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(n)
            cascade(n//10)
            print(n)
>>> cascade(2013)
2013
201
20
2
20
201
2013
```

In this recursive function, the base case is a single-digit number, which is printed. Otherwise, a recursive call is placed between two calls to `print`.

It is not a rigid requirement that base cases be expressed before recursive calls. In fact, this function can be expressed more compactly by observing that `print(n)` is repeated in both clauses of the conditional statement, and therefore can precede it.

```
>>> def cascade(n):
        """Print a cascade of prefixes of n."""
        print(n)
        if n >= 10:
            cascade(n//10)
            print(n)
```

As another example of mutual recursion, consider a two-player game in which there are `n` initial pebbles on a table. The players take turns, removing either one or two pebbles from the table, and the player who removes the final pebble wins. Suppose that Alice and Bob play this game, each using a simple strategy:

- Alice always removes a single pebble
- Bob removes two pebbles if an even number of pebbles is on the table, and one otherwise

Given `n` initial pebbles and Alice starting, who wins the game?

A natural decomposition of this problem is to encapsulate each strategy in its own function. This allows us to modify one strategy without affecting the other, maintaining the abstraction barrier between the two. In order to incorporate the turn-by-turn nature of the game, these two functions call each other at the end of each turn.

```
>>> def play_alice(n):
        if n == 0:
            print("Bob wins!")
        else:
            play_bob(n-1)
>>> def play_bob(n):
        if n == 0:
            print("Alice wins!")
        elif is_even(n):
            play_alice(n-2)
        else:
            play_alice(n-1)
>>> play_alice(20)
Bob wins!
```

In `play_bob`, we see that multiple recursive calls may appear in the body of a function. However, in this example, each call to `play_bob` calls `play_alice` at most once. In the next section, we consider what happens when a single function call makes multiple direct recursive calls.

### 1.7.4 Tree Recursion

Another common pattern of computation is called tree recursion, in which a function calls itself more than once. As an example, consider computing the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, in which each number is the sum of the preceding two.

```PYTHON
def fib(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)

result = fib(6)
```

This recursive definition is tremendously appealing relative to our previous attempts: it exactly mirrors the familiar definition of Fibonacci numbers. A function with multiple recursive calls is said to be ***tree recursive*** because each call branches into multiple smaller calls, each of which branches into yet smaller calls, just as the branches of a tree become smaller but more numerous as they extend from the trunk.

We were already able to define a function to compute Fibonacci numbers without tree recursion. In fact, our previous attempts were more efficient, a topic discussed later in the text. Next, we consider a problem for which the tree recursive solution is substantially simpler than any iterative alternative.

### 1.7.5 Example: Partitions

The number of partitions of a positive integer `n`, using parts up to size `m`, is the number of ways in which `n` can be expressed as the sum of positive integer parts up to `m` in increasing order. For example, the number of partitions of 6 using parts up to 4 is 9.

1. `6 = 2 + 4`
2. `6 = 1 + 1 + 4`
3. `6 = 3 + 3`
4. `6 = 1 + 2 + 3`
5. `6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3`
6. `6 = 2 + 2 + 2`
7. `6 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2`
8. `6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2`
9. `6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`

We will define a function `count_partitions(n, m)` that returns the number of different partitions of `n` using parts up to `m`. This function has a simple solution as a tree-recursive function, based on the following observation:

The number of ways to partition `n` using integers up to `m` equals

1. the number of ways to partition `n-m` using integers up to `m`, and
2. the number of ways to partition `n` using integers up to `m-1`.

To see why this is true, observe that all the ways of partitioning `n` can be divided into two groups: those that include at least one `m` and those that do not. Moreover, each partition in the first group is a partition of `n-m`, followed by `m` added at the end. In the example above, the first two partitions contain 4, and the rest do not.

Therefore, we can recursively reduce the problem of partitioning `n` using integers up to `m` into two simpler problems: (1) partition a smaller number `n-m`, and (2) partition with smaller components up to `m-1`.

To complete the implementation, we need to specify the following base cases:

1. There is one way to partition 0: include no parts.
2. There are 0 ways to partition a negative `n`.
3. There are 0 ways to partition any `n` greater than 0 using parts of size 0 or less.

```py
>>> def count_partitions(n, m):
        """Count the ways to partition n using parts up to m."""
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        elif n < 0:
            return 0
        elif m == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            return count_partitions(n-m, m) + count_partitions(n, m-1)
>>> count_partitions(6, 4)
9
>>> count_partitions(5, 5)
7
>>> count_partitions(10, 10)
42
>>> count_partitions(15, 15)
176
>>> count_partitions(20, 20)
627
```

We can think of a tree-recursive function as exploring different possibilities. In this case, we explore the possibility that we use a part of size `m` and the possibility that we do not. The first and second recursive calls correspond to these possibilities.

Implementing this function without recursion would be substantially more involved. Interested readers are encouraged to try.

What's the difference between recursion and self-referencing?

Recursion involves making a **call** to f within the body of f, and this is complicated. Because when i call f on something
i might get many many calls to f as a result, even though I've only like called it on one thing, it can kick off a whole chain of computation .

Self-reference is using the **name** of the function that you're defining somewhere within its body, this will not kick off some long chain kind of you're only going to get one call for f for each time that you call it.

We focus on recursion because it's powerful but also because it really pushes you to just trust that a function is going to do what it's going to do. because there's kind of no other way to deal with recursion, but this idea this **functional abstraction** idea of just like oh i have this function it's going to do what it's going to do is extremely useful outside of writing recursive functions, just <u>whenever you're writing a large program you can just not worry about how some  function does its thing, you just call it and you assume that you'll get the right result</u>, because you understand conceptually what its behavior is and that's how you build large programs is that you kind of trust that each
piece is going to do what it's supposed to do. you have to verify each piece and and then you compose them not by tracing through the whole program but instead by validating each piece assuming the rest works

In a tree recursive problem, **Don't try to trace through the next call**

# Chapter 2: Building Abstractions with Data

## 2.1 Introduction

We concentrated in Chapter 1 on computational processes and on the role of functions in program design. We saw how to use primitive data (numbers) and primitive operations (arithmetic), how to form compound functions through composition and control, and how to create functional abstractions by giving names to processes. We also saw that higher-order functions enhance the power of our language by enabling us to manipulate, and thereby to reason, in terms of general methods of computation. This is much of the essence of programming.

This chapter focuses on data. The techniques we investigate here will allow us to represent and manipulate information about many different domains. Due to the explosive growth of the Internet, a vast amount of structured information is freely available to all of us online, and computation can be applied to a vast range of different problems. Effective use of built-in and user-defined data types are fundamental to data processing applications.

### 2.1.1 Native Data Types

Every value in Python has a ***class*** that determines what type of value it is. Values that share a class also share behavior. For example, the integers `1` and `2` are both instances of the `int` class. These two values can be treated similarly. For example, they can both be negated or added to another integer. The built-in `type` function allows us to inspect the class of any value.

```
>>> type(2)
<class 'int'>
```

The values we have used so far are instances of a small number of *native* data types that are built into the Python language. Native data types have the following properties:

1. There are expressions that evaluate to values of native types, called ***literals***.
2. There are built-in functions and operators to manipulate values of native types.

The `int` class is the native data type used to represent integers. <u>Integer literals (sequences of adjacent numerals) evaluate to `int` values, and mathematical operators manipulate these values.</u>

```
>>> 12 + 3000000000000000000000000
3000000000000000000000012
```

Python includes three native numeric types: integers (`int`), real numbers (`float`), and complex numbers (`complex`).

```
>>> type(1.5)
<class 'float'>
>>> type(1+1j)
<class 'complex'>
```

**Floats.** The name `float` comes from the way in which real numbers are represented in Python and many other programming languages: a "floating point" representation. While the details of how numbers are represented is not a topic for this text, some high-level differences between `int` and `float` objects are important to know. In particular, `int` objects represent integers exactly, without any approximation or limits on their size. On the other hand, `float` objects can represent a wide range of fractional numbers, but not all numbers can be represented exactly, and there are minimum and maximum values. Therefore, `float` values should be treated as approximations to real values. These approximations have only a finite amount of precision. Combining `float` values can lead to approximation errors; both of the following expressions would evaluate to `7` if not for approximation.

```
>>> 7 / 3 * 3
7.0
>>> 1 / 3 * 7 * 3
6.999999999999999
```

Although `int` values are combined above, dividing one `int` by another yields a `float` value: a truncated finite approximation to the actual ratio of the two integers divided.

```
>>> type(1/3)
<class 'float'>
>>> 1/3
0.3333333333333333
```

Problems with this approximation appear when we conduct equality tests.

```
>>> 1/3 == 0.333333333333333312345  # Beware of float approximation
True
```

These subtle differences between the `int` and `float` class have wide-ranging consequences for writing programs, and so they are details that must be memorized by programmers. Fortunately, there are only a handful of native data types, limiting the amount of memorization required to become proficient in a programming language. Moreover, these same details are consistent across many programming languages, enforced by community guidelines such as the [IEEE 754 floating point standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point).

**Non-numeric types.** Values can represent many other types of data, such as sounds, images, locations, web addresses, network connections, and more. A few are represented by native data types, such as the `bool` class for values `True` and `False`. The type for most values must be defined by programmers using the means of combination and abstraction that we will develop in this chapter.

The following sections introduce more of Python's native data types, focusing on the role they play in creating useful data abstractions. For those interested in further details, a chapter on [native data types](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/native-datatypes.html) in the online book Dive Into Python 3 gives a pragmatic overview of all Python's native data types and how to manipulate them, including numerous usage examples and practical tips.

## 2.2 Data Abstraction

As we consider the wide set of things in the world that we would like to represent in our programs, we find that most of them have compound structure. For example, a geographic position has latitude and longitude coordinates. To represent positions, we would like our programming language to have the capacity to couple together a latitude and longitude to form a pair, a ***compound data*** value that our programs can manipulate as a single conceptual unit, but which also has two parts that can be considered individually.

The use of compound data enables us to increase the modularity of our programs. If we can manipulate geographic positions as whole values, then we can shield parts of our program that compute using positions from the details of how those positions are represented. **The general technique of isolating the parts of a program that deal with how data are represented from the parts that deal with how data are manipulated is a powerful design methodology** called ***data abstraction***. Data abstraction makes programs much easier to design, maintain, and modify.

Data abstraction is similar in character to functional abstraction. When we create a functional abstraction, the details of how a function is implemented can be suppressed, and the particular function itself can be replaced by any other function with the same overall behavior. In other words, we can make an abstraction that separates the way the function is used from the details of how the function is implemented. Analogously, data abstraction isolates how a compound data value is used from the details of how it is constructed.

The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure programs so that they operate on abstract data. That is, our programs should use data in such a way as to make as few assumptions about the data as possible. At the same time, a concrete data representation is defined as an independent part of the program.

These two parts of a program, the part that **operates on abstract data** and the part that **defines a concrete representation**, are connected by a small set of functions that **implement abstract data in terms of the concrete representation**. To illustrate this technique, we will consider how to design a set of functions for manipulating rational numbers.

### 2.2.1 Example: Rational Numbers

A rational number is a ratio of integers, and rational numbers constitute an important sub-class of real numbers. A rational number such as `1/3` or `17/29` is typically written as:

```
<numerator>/<denominator>
```

where both the `<numerator>` and `<denominator>` are placeholders for integer values. Both parts are needed to exactly characterize the value of the rational number. Actually dividing integers produces a `float` approximation, losing the exact precision of integers.

```
>>> 1/3
0.3333333333333333
>>> 1/3 == 0.333333333333333300000  # Dividing integers yields an approximation
True
```

However, we can create an exact representation for rational numbers by combining together the numerator and denominator.

We know from using functional abstractions that we can start programming productively before we have an implementation of some parts of our program. Let us begin by assuming that we already have a way of constructing a rational number from a numerator and a denominator. We also assume that, given a rational number, we have a way of selecting its numerator and its denominator component. Let us further assume that the constructor and selectors are available as the following three functions:

- `rational(n, d)` returns the rational number with numerator `n` and denominator `d`.
- `numer(x)` returns the numerator of the rational number `x`.
- `denom(x)` returns the denominator of the rational number `x`.

We are using here a powerful strategy for designing programs: ***wishful thinking***. We haven't yet said how a rational number is represented, or how the functions `numer`, `denom`, and `rational` should be implemented. Even so, if we did define these three functions, we could then add, multiply, print, and test equality of rational numbers:

```
>>> def add_rationals(x, y):
        nx, dx = numer(x), denom(x)
        ny, dy = numer(y), denom(y)
        return rational(nx * dy + ny * dx, dx * dy)
>>> def mul_rationals(x, y):
        return rational(numer(x) * numer(y), denom(x) * denom(y))
>>> def print_rational(x):
        print(numer(x), '/', denom(x))
>>> def rationals_are_equal(x, y):
        return numer(x) * denom(y) == numer(y) * denom(x)
```

Now we have the operations on rational numbers defined in terms of the selector functions `numer` and `denom`, and the constructor function `rational`, but we haven't yet defined these functions. What we need is some way to glue together a numerator and a denominator into a compound value.

### 2.2.2 Pairs

To enable us to implement the concrete level of our data abstraction, Python provides a compound structure called a `list`, which can be constructed by placing expressions within square brackets separated by commas. Such an expression is called a list literal.

```
>>> [10, 20]
[10, 20]
```

The elements of a list can be accessed in two ways. The first way is via our familiar method of multiple assignment, which unpacks a list into its elements and binds each element to a different name.

```
>>> pair = [10, 20]
>>> pair
[10, 20]
>>> x, y = pair
>>> x
10
>>> y
20
```

A second method for accessing the elements in a list is by the element selection operator, also expressed using square brackets. Unlike a list literal, a square-brackets expression directly following another expression does not evaluate to a `list` value, but instead selects an element from the value of the preceding expression.

```
>>> pair[0]
10
>>> pair[1]
20
```

Lists in Python (and sequences in most other programming languages) are **0-indexed**, meaning that the index 0 selects the first element, index 1 selects the second, and so on. **One intuition that supports this indexing convention is that the index represents how far an element is offset from the beginning of the list.**

The equivalent function for the element selection operator is called **`getitem`**, and it also uses 0-indexed positions to select elements from a list.

```
>>> from operator import getitem
>>> getitem(pair, 0)
10
>>> getitem(pair, 1)
20
```

Two-element lists are not the only method of representing pairs in Python. Any way of bundling two values together into one can be considered a pair. Lists are a common method to do so. Lists can also contain more than two elements, as we will explore later in the chapter.

**Representing Rational Numbers.** We can now represent a rational number as a pair of two integers: a numerator and a denominator.

```
>>> def rational(n, d):
        return [n, d]
>>> def numer(x):
        return x[0]
>>> def denom(x):
        return x[1]
```

Together with the arithmetic operations we defined earlier, we can manipulate rational numbers with the functions we have defined.

```
>>> half = rational(1, 2)
>>> print_rational(half)
1 / 2
>>> third = rational(1, 3)
>>> print_rational(mul_rationals(half, third))
1 / 6
>>> print_rational(add_rationals(third, third))
6 / 9
```

As the example above shows, our rational number implementation does not reduce rational numbers to lowest terms. We can remedy this flaw by changing the implementation of `rational`. If we have a function for computing the greatest common denominator of two integers, we can use it to reduce the numerator and the denominator to lowest terms before constructing the pair. As with many useful tools, such a function already exists in the Python Library.

```
>>> from fractions import gcd
>>> def rational(n, d):
        g = gcd(n, d)
        return (n//g, d//g)
```

The floor division operator, `//`, expresses integer division, which rounds down the fractional part of the result of division. Since we know that `g` divides both `n` and `d` evenly, integer division is exact in this case. This revised `rational` implementation ensures that rationals are expressed in lowest terms.

```
>>> print_rational(add_rationals(third, third))
2 / 3
```

This improvement was accomplished by changing the constructor without changing any of the functions that implement the actual arithmetic operations.

### 2.2.3 Abstraction Barriers

Before continuing with more examples of compound data and data abstraction, let us consider some of the issues raised by the rational number example. We defined operations in terms of a constructor `rational` and selectors `numer` and `denom`. In general, the underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of values of some kind will be expressed, and then to use only those operations in manipulating the data. By restricting the use of operations in this way, it is much easier to change the representation of abstract data without changing the behavior of a program.

For rational numbers, different parts of the program manipulate rational numbers using different operations, as described in this table.

| **Parts of the program that...**                  | **Treat rationals as...**   | **Using only...**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use rational numbers to perform computation       | whole data values           | `add_rational, mul_rational, rationals_are_equal, print_rational` |
| Create rationals or implement rational operations | numerators and denominators | `rational, numer, denom`                                     |
| Implement selectors and constructor for rationals | two-element lists           | list literals and element selection                          |

In each layer above, the functions in the final column enforce an abstraction barrier. These functions are called by a higher level and implemented using a lower level of abstraction.

An **abstraction barrier violation** occurs whenever a part of the program that can use a higher level function instead uses a function in a lower level. For example, a function that computes the square of a rational number is best implemented in terms of `mul_rational`, which does not assume anything about the implementation of a rational number.

```
>>> def square_rational(x):
        return mul_rational(x, x)
```

<u>Referring directly to numerators and denominators would violate one abstraction barrier.</u>

```
>>> def square_rational_violating_once(x):
        return rational(numer(x) * numer(x), denom(x) * denom(x))
```

<u>Assuming that rationals are represented as two-element lists would violate two abstraction barriers.</u>

```
>>> def square_rational_violating_twice(x):
        return [x[0] * x[0], x[1] * x[1]]
```

Abstraction barriers make programs easier to maintain and to modify. <u>The fewer functions that depend on a particular representation, the fewer changes are required when one wants to change that representation.</u> All of these implementations of `square_rational` have the correct behavior, but only the first is robust to future changes. The `square_rational` function would not require updating even if we altered the representation of rational numbers. By contrast, `square_rational_violating_once` would need to be changed whenever the selector or constructor signatures changed, and `square_rational_violating_twice` would require updating whenever the implementation of rational numbers changed.

### 2.2.4 The Properties of Data

Abstraction barriers shape the way in which we think about data. A valid representation of a rational number is not restricted to any particular implementation (such as a two-element list); it is a value returned by `rational` that can be passed to `numer`, and `denom`. In addition, the appropriate relationship must hold among the constructor and selectors. That is, if we construct a rational number `x` from integers `n` and `d`, then it should be the case that `numer(x)/denom(x)` is equal to `n/d`.

**In general, we can express abstract data using a collection of selectors and constructors, together with some behavior conditions. As long as the behavior conditions are met (such as the division property above), the selectors and constructors constitute a valid representation of a kind of data.** The implementation details below an abstraction barrier may change, but if the behavior does not, then the data abstraction remains valid, and any program written using this data abstraction will remain correct.

This point of view can be applied broadly, including to the pair values that we used to implement rational numbers. We never actually said much about what a pair was, only that the language supplied the means to create and manipulate lists with two elements. The behavior we require to implement a pair is that it glues two values together. Stated as a behavior condition,

- If a pair `p` was constructed from values `x` and `y`, then `select(p, 0)` returns `x`, and `select(p, 1)` returns `y`.

We don't actually need the `list` type to create pairs. Instead, we can implement two functions `pair` and `select` that fulfill this description just as well as a two-element list.

```
>>> def pair(x, y):
        """Return a function that represents a pair."""
        def get(index):
            if index == 0:
                return x
            elif index == 1:
                return y
        return get
>>> def select(p, i):
        """Return the element at index i of pair p."""
        return p(i)
```

With this implementation, we can create and manipulate pairs.

```
>>> p = pair(20, 14)
>>> select(p, 0)
20
>>> select(p, 1)
14
```

This use of higher-order functions corresponds to nothing like our intuitive notion of what data should be. Nevertheless, these functions suffice to represent pairs in our programs. Functions are sufficient to represent compound data.

The point of exhibiting the functional representation of a pair is not that Python actually works this way (lists are implemented more directly, for efficiency reasons) but that it could work this way. The functional representation, although obscure, is a perfectly adequate way to represent pairs, since it fulfills the only conditions that pairs need to fulfill. The practice of data abstraction allows us to switch among representations easily.

### Data Abstraction

```python
# Rational arithmetic

def add_rational(x, y):
    """The sum of rational numbers X and Y."""
    nx, dx = numer(x), denom(x)
    ny, dy = numer(y), denom(y)
    return rational(nx * dy + ny * dx, dx * dy)

def mul_rational(x, y):
    """The product of rational numbers X and Y."""
    return rational(numer(x) * numer(y), denom(x) * denom(y))

def rationals_are_equal(x, y):
    """True iff rational numbers X and Y are equal."""
    return numer(x) * denom(y) == numer(y) * denom(x)

def print_rational(x):
    """Print rational X."""
    print(numer(x), "/", denom(x))

    """A representation of the rational number N/D."""
    return [n, d]

def numer(x):
    """Return the numerator of rational number X."""
    return x[0]

def denom(x):
    """Return the denominator of rational number X."""
    return x[1]


# Improved specification

    """A representation of the rational number N/D."""
    g = gcd(n, d)
    return [n//g, d//g]

    """Return the numerator of rational number X in lowest terms and having
    the sign of X."""
    return x[0]

def denom(x):
    """Return the denominator of rational number X in lowest terms and positive."""
    return x[1]


# Functional implementation

def rational(n, d):
    """A representation of the rational number N/D."""
    g = gcd(n, d)
    n, d = n//g, d//g
    def select(name):
        if name == 'n':
            return n
        elif name == 'd':
            return d
    return select

def numer(x):
    """Return the numerator of rational number X in lowest terms and having
    the sign of X."""
    return x('n')

def denom(x):
    """Return the denominator of rational number X in lowest terms and positive."""
    return x('d')

# Dicts

def dict_demos():
    numerals = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10}
    numerals['X']
    numerals.values()
    list(numerals.values())
    sum(numerals.values())
    dict([(3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)])
    numerals.get('X', 0)
    numerals.get('X-ray', 0)
    {x: x*x for x in range(3,6)}

    {1: 2, 1: 3}
    {[1]: 2}
    {1: [2]}
```

## 2.3 Sequences

A sequence is an ordered collection of values. The sequence is a powerful, fundamental abstraction in computer science. Sequences are not instances of a particular built-in type or abstract data representation, but instead a collection of behaviors that are shared among several different types of data. That is, there are many kinds of sequences, but they all share common behavior. In particular,

**Length.** A sequence has a finite length. An empty sequence has length 0.

**Element selection.** A sequence has an element corresponding to any non-negative integer index less than its length, starting at 0 for the first element.

Python includes several native data types that are sequences, the most important of which is the `list`.

### 2.3.1 Lists

A `list` value is a sequence that can have arbitrary length. Lists have a large set of built-in behaviors, along with specific syntax to express those behaviors. We have already seen the list literal, which evaluates to a `list` instance, as well as an element selection expression that evaluates to a value in the list. The built-in `len` function returns the length of a sequence. Below, `digits` is a list with four elements. The element at index 3 is 8.

```
>>> digits = [1, 8, 2, 8]
>>> len(digits)
4
>>> digits[3]
8
```

Additionally, lists can be added together and multiplied by integers. For sequences, addition and multiplication do not add or multiply elements, but instead **combine and replicate the sequences themselves.** That is, the `add` function in the `operator` module (and the `+` operator) yields a list that is the concatenation of the added arguments. The `mul` function in `operator` (and the `*` operator) can take a list and an integer `k` to return the list that consists of `k` repetitions of the original list.

```
>>> [2, 7] + digits * 2
[2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 8]
```

**Any values can be included in a list, including another list.** Element selection can be applied multiple times in order to select a deeply nested element in a list containing lists.

```
>>> pairs = [[10, 20], [30, 40]]
>>> pairs[1]
[30, 40]
>>> pairs[1][0]
30
```

### 2.3.2 Sequence Iteration

In many cases, we would like to iterate over the elements of a sequence and perform some computation for each element in turn. This pattern is so common that Python has an additional control statement to process sequential data: the `for` statement.

Consider the problem of counting how many times a value appears in a sequence. We can implement a function to compute this count using a `while` loop.

```
>>> def count(s, value):
        """Count the number of occurrences of value in sequence s."""
        total, index = 0, 0
        while index < len(s):
            if s[index] == value:
                total = total + 1
            index = index + 1
        return total
>>> count(digits, 8)
2
```

The Python `for` statement can simplify this function body by iterating over the element values directly without introducing the name `index` at all.

```
>>> def count(s, value):
        """Count the number of occurrences of value in sequence s."""
        total = 0
        for elem in s:
            if elem == value:
                total = total + 1
        return total
>>> count(digits, 8)
2
```

A `for` statement consists of a single clause with the form:

```
for <name> in <expression>:
    <suite>
```

A `for` statement is executed by the following procedure:

1. **Evaluate the header `<expression>`, which must yield an iterable value.**
2. **For each element value in that iterable value, in order:**
   1. **Bind `<name>` to that value in the current frame.**
   2. **Execute the `<suite>`.**

This execution procedure refers to ***iterable values***. Lists are a type of sequence, and sequences are iterable values. Their elements are considered in their sequential order. Python includes other iterable types, but we will focus on sequences for now; the general definition of the term "iterable" appears in the section on iterators in Chapter 4.

**An important consequence of this evaluation procedure is that `<name>` will be bound to the last element of the sequence after the `for` statement is executed.**  The `for` loop introduces yet another way in which the environment can be updated by a statement.

**Sequence unpacking.** A common pattern in programs is to have a sequence of elements that are themselves sequences, but all of a fixed length. A `for` statement may include multiple names in its header to "unpack" each element sequence into its respective elements. For example, we may have a list of two-element lists.

```
>>> pairs = [[1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3], [4, 4]]
```

and wish to find the number of these pairs that have the same first and second element.

```
>>> same_count = 0
```

The following `for` statement with two names in its header will bind each name `x` and `y` to the first and second elements in each pair, respectively.

```
>>> for x, y in pairs:
        if x == y:
            same_count = same_count + 1
>>> same_count
2
```

This pattern of binding multiple names to multiple values in a fixed-length sequence is called ***sequence unpacking***; it is the same pattern that we see in assignment statements that bind multiple names to multiple values.

**Ranges.** A `range` is another built-in type of sequence in Python, which represents a range of integers. Ranges are created with `range`, which takes two integer arguments: the first number and one beyond the last number in the desired range.

```
>>> range(1, 10)  # Includes 1, but not 10
range(1, 10)
```

Calling the `list` constructor on a range evaluates to a list with the same elements as the range, so that the elements can be easily inspected.

```
>>> list(range(5, 8))
[5, 6, 7]
```

If only one argument is given, it is interpreted as one beyond the last value for a range that **starts at 0.**

```
>>> list(range(4))
[0, 1, 2, 3]
```

Ranges commonly appear as the expression in a `for` header to specify the number of times that the suite should be executed: **A common convention is to use a single underscore character for the name in the `for` header if the name is unused in the suite**:

```
>>> for _ in range(3):
        print('Go Bears!')

Go Bears!
Go Bears!
Go Bears!
```

This underscore is just another name in the environment as far as the interpreter is concerned, but has a conventional meaning among programmers that indicates the name will not appear in any future expressions.

### 2.3.3 Sequence Processing

Sequences are such a common form of compound data that whole programs are often organized around this single abstraction. Modular components that have sequences as both inputs and outputs can be mixed and matched to perform data processing. Complex components can be defined by chaining together a pipeline of sequence processing operations, each of which is simple and focused.

**List Comprehensions.** Many sequence processing operations can be expressed by evaluating a fixed expression for each element in a sequence and collecting the resulting values in a result sequence. In Python, a list comprehension is an expression that performs such a computation.

```
>>> odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
>>> [x+1 for x in odds]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

The `for` keyword above is not part of a `for` statement, but instead part of a list comprehension because it is contained within square brackets. The sub-expression `x+1` is evaluated with `x` bound to each element of `odds` in turn, and the resulting values are collected into a list.

Another common sequence processing operation is to select a subset of values that satisfy some condition. List comprehensions can also express this pattern, for instance selecting all elements of `odds`  that evenly divide `25`.

```
>>> [x for x in odds if 25 % x == 0]
[1, 5]
```

The general form of a list comprehension is:

```
[<map expression> for <name> in <sequence expression> if <filter expression>]
```

**To evaluate a list comprehension, Python evaluates the `<sequence expression>`, which must return an iterable value. Then, for each element in order, the element value is bound to `<name>`, the filter expression is evaluated, and if it yields a true value, the map expression is evaluated. The values of the map expression are collected into a list.**

**Aggregation.** A third common pattern in sequence processing is to aggregate all values in a sequence into a single value. The built-in functions `sum`, `min`, and `max` are all examples of aggregation functions.

By combining the patterns of evaluating an expression for each element, selecting a subset of elements, and aggregating elements, we can solve problems using a sequence processing approach.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its divisors. The divisors of `n` are positive integers less than `n` that divide evenly into `n`. Listing the divisors of `n` can be expressed with a list comprehension.

```
>>> def divisors(n):
        return [1] + [x for x in range(2, n) if n % x == 0]
>>> divisors(4)
[1, 2]
>>> divisors(12)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
```

Using `divisors`, we can compute all perfect numbers from 1 to 1000 with another list comprehension. (1 is typically considered to be a perfect number as well, but it does not qualify under our definition of `divisors`.)

```
>>> [n for n in range(1, 1000) if sum(divisors(n)) == n]
[6, 28, 496]
```

We can reuse our definition of `divisors` to solve another problem, finding the minimum perimeter of a rectangle with integer side lengths, given its area. The area of a rectangle is its height times its width. Therefore, given the area and height, we can compute the width. We can assert that both the width and height evenly divide the area to ensure that the side lengths are integers.

```
>>> def width(area, height):
        assert area % height == 0
        return area // height
```

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of its side lengths.

```
>>> def perimeter(width, height):
        return 2 * width + 2 * height
```

The height of a rectangle with integer side lengths must be a divisor of its area. We can compute the minimum perimeter by considering all heights.

```
>>> def minimum_perimeter(area):
        heights = divisors(area)
        perimeters = [perimeter(width(area, h), h) for h in heights]
        return min(perimeters)
>>> area = 80
>>> width(area, 5)
16
>>> perimeter(16, 5)
42
>>> perimeter(10, 8)
36
>>> minimum_perimeter(area)
36
>>> [minimum_perimeter(n) for n in range(1, 10)]
[4, 6, 8, 8, 12, 10, 16, 12, 12]
```

**Higher-Order Functions.** The common patterns we have observed in sequence processing can be expressed using higher-order functions. First, evaluating an expression for each element in a sequence can be expressed by applying a function to each element.

```
>>> def apply_to_all(map_fn, s):
        return [map_fn(x) for x in s]
```

Selecting only elements for which some expression is true can be expressed by applying a function to each element.

```
>>> def keep_if(filter_fn, s):
        return [x for x in s if filter_fn(x)]
```

Finally, many forms of aggregation can be expressed as repeatedly applying a two-argument function to the `reduced` value so far and each element in turn.

```
>>> def reduce(reduce_fn, s, initial):
        reduced = initial
        for x in s:
            reduced = reduce_fn(reduced, x)
        return reduced
```

For example, `reduce` can be used to multiply together all elements of a sequence. Using `mul` as the `reduce_fn` and 1 as the `initial` value, `reduce` can be used to multiply together a sequence of numbers.

```
>>> reduce(mul, [2, 4, 8], 1)
64
```

We can find perfect numbers using these higher-order functions as well.

```
>>> def divisors_of(n):
        divides_n = lambda x: n % x == 0
        return [1] + keep_if(divides_n, range(2, n))
>>> divisors_of(12)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
>>> from operator import add
>>> def sum_of_divisors(n):
        return reduce(add, divisors_of(n), 0)
>>> def perfect(n):
        return sum_of_divisors(n) == n
>>> keep_if(perfect, range(1, 1000))
[1, 6, 28, 496]
```

**Conventional Names.**  In the computer science community, the more common name for `apply_to_all` is `map` and the more common name for `keep_if` is `filter`. In Python, the built-in `map` and `filter` are generalizations of these functions that do not return lists. These functions are discussed in Chapter 4. **The definitions above are equivalent to applying the `list` constructor to the result of built-in `map` and `filter` calls.**

```
>>> apply_to_all = lambda map_fn, s: list(map(map_fn, s))
>>> keep_if = lambda filter_fn, s: list(filter(filter_fn, s))
```

The `reduce` function is built into the `functools` module of the Python standard library. In this version, the `initial` argument is optional.

```
>>> from functools import reduce
>>> from operator import mul
>>> def product(s):
        return reduce(mul, s)
>>> product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
120
```

In Python programs, it is more common to use list comprehensions directly rather than higher-order functions, but both approaches to sequence processing are widely used.

### 2.3.4 Sequence Abstraction

We have introduced two native data types that satisfy the sequence abstraction: lists and ranges. Both satisfy the conditions with which we began this section: length and element selection. Python includes two more behaviors of sequence types that extend the sequence abstraction.

**Membership.**  A value can be tested for membership in a sequence. Python has two operators `in` and `not in` that evaluate to `True` or `False` depending on whether an element appears in a sequence.

```
>>> digits
[1, 8, 2, 8]
>>> 2 in digits
True
>>> 1828 not in digits
True
```

**Slicing.** Sequences contain smaller sequences within them. A ***slice*** of a sequence is any contiguous span of the original sequence, designated by a pair of integers. As with the `range` constructor, the first integer indicates the starting index of the slice and the second indicates one beyond the ending index.

In Python, sequence slicing is expressed similarly to element selection, using square brackets. A colon separates the starting and ending indices. Any bound that is omitted is assumed to be an extreme value: 0 for the starting index, and the length of the sequence for the ending index.

```
>>> digits[0:2]
[1, 8]
>>> digits[1:]
[8, 2, 8]
```

Enumerating these additional behaviors of the Python sequence abstraction gives us an opportunity to reflect upon what constitutes a useful data abstraction in general. **The richness of an abstraction** (that is, how many behaviors it includes) has consequences. For users of an abstraction, additional behaviors can be helpful. On the other hand, satisfying the requirements of a rich abstraction with a new data type can be challenging. Another negative consequence of rich abstractions is that they take longer for users to learn.

Sequences have a rich abstraction because they are so ubiquitous in computing that learning a few complex behaviors is justified. **In general, most user-defined abstractions should be kept as simple as possible.**

**Further reading.** Slice notation admits a variety of special cases, such as negative starting values, ending values, and step sizes. A complete description appears in the subsection called [slicing a list](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/native-datatypes.html#slicinglists) in Dive Into Python 3. In this chapter, we will only use the basic features described above.

### 2.3.5 Strings

Text values are perhaps more fundamental to computer science than even numbers. As a case in point, Python programs are written and stored as text. The native data type for text in Python is called a string, and corresponds to the constructor `str`.

There are many details of how strings are represented, expressed, and manipulated in Python. Strings are another example of a rich abstraction, one that requires a substantial commitment on the part of the programmer to master. This section serves as a condensed introduction to essential string behaviors.

String literals can express arbitrary text, surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.

```
>>> 'I am string!'
'I am string!'
>>> "I've got an apostrophe"
"I've got an apostrophe"
>>> '您好'
'您好'
```

We have seen strings already in our code, as docstrings, in calls to `print`, and as error messages in `assert` statements.

Strings satisfy the two basic conditions of a sequence that we introduced at the beginning of this section: they have a length and they support element selection.

```
>>> city = 'Berkeley'
>>> len(city)
8
>>> city[3]
'k'
```

The elements of a string are themselves strings that have only a single character. A character is any single letter of the alphabet, punctuation mark, or other symbol. Unlike many other programming languages, **Python does not have a separate character type; any text is a string, and strings that represent single characters have a length of 1.**

Like lists, strings can also be combined via addition and multiplication.

```
>>> 'Berkeley' + ', CA'
'Berkeley, CA'
>>> 'Shabu ' * 2
'Shabu Shabu '
```

**Membership.** The behavior of strings diverges from other sequence types in Python. The string abstraction does not conform to the full sequence abstraction that we described for lists and ranges. In particular, the membership operator `in` applies to strings, but has an entirely different behavior than when it is applied to sequences. It matches substrings rather than elements.

```
>>> 'here' in "Where's Waldo?"
True
```

**Multiline Literals.** Strings aren't limited to a single line. Triple quotes delimit string literals that span multiple lines. We have used this triple quoting extensively already for docstrings.

```
>>> """The Zen of Python
claims, Readability counts.
Read more: import this."""
'The Zen of Python\nclaims, "Readability counts."\nRead more: import this.'
```

In the printed result above, **the `\n` (pronounced "*backslash en*") is a single element that represents a new line. Although it appears as two characters (backslash and "n"), it is considered a single character for the purposes of length and element selection.**

**String Coercion.** A string can be created from any object in Python by calling the `str` constructor function with an object value as its argument. This feature of strings is useful for constructing descriptive strings from objects of various types.

```
>>> str(2) + ' is an element of ' + str(digits)
'2 is an element of [1, 8, 2, 8]'
```

**Further reading.** Encoding text in computers is a complex topic. In this chapter, we will abstract away the details of how strings are represented. However, for many applications, the particular details of how strings are encoded by computers is essential knowledge. [The strings chapter of Dive Into Python 3](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/strings.html) provides a description of character encodings and Unicode.

```

the term **literal** is actually just describing cases in which you build something by just writing out its contents in the code as opposed to building it out programmatically through iteration or something like that

so a string literal is when you build a string just by writing quote and then the contents of the string and then end
quote and a list literal is when you build a list by just typing out its elements inside of square brackets 

this term **helper function** is used to describe a function that isn't really useful on its own instead it's part of the implementation of another function

### 2.3.6 Trees

Our ability to use lists as the elements of other lists provides a new means of combination in our programming language. This ability is called a ***closure property*** of a data type. In general, a method for combining data values has a closure property if the result of combination can itself be combined using the same method. Closure is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to create hierarchical structures — structures made up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts, and so on.

We can visualize lists in environment diagrams using ***box-and-pointer*** notation. A list is depicted as adjacent boxes that contain the elements of the list. Primitive values such as numbers, strings, boolean values, and `None` appear within an element box. Composite values, such as function values and other lists, are indicated by an arrow.

Nesting lists within lists can introduce complexity. The ***tree*** is a fundamental data abstraction that imposes regularity on how hierarchical values are structured and manipulated.

A tree has a root label and a sequence of branches. Each branch of a tree is a tree. A tree with no branches is called a leaf. Any tree contained within a tree is called a **sub-tree** of that tree (such as a branch of a branch). The root of each sub-tree of a tree is called a **node** in that tree.

The data abstraction for a tree consists of the constructor `tree` and the selectors `label` and `branches`. We begin with a simplified version.

```
>>> def tree(root_label, branches=[]):
        for branch in branches:
            assert is_tree(branch), 'branches must be trees'
        return [root_label] + list(branches)
>>> def label(tree):
        return tree[0]
>>> def branches(tree):
        return tree[1:]
```

A tree is well-formed only if it has a root label and all branches are also trees. The `is_tree` function is applied in the `tree` constructor to verify that all branches are well-formed.

```
>>> def is_tree(tree):
        if type(tree) != list or len(tree) < 1:
            return False
        for branch in branches(tree):
            if not is_tree(branch):
                return False
        return True
```

The `is_leaf` function checks whether or not a tree has branches.

```
>>> def is_leaf(tree):
        return not branches(tree)
```

Trees can be constructed by nested expressions. The following tree `t` has root label 3 and two branches.

```
>>> t = tree(3, [tree(1), tree(2, [tree(1), tree(1)])])
>>> t
[3, [1], [2, [1], [1]]]
>>> label(t)
3
>>> branches(t)
[[1], [2, [1], [1]]]
>>> label(branches(t)[1])
2
>>> is_leaf(t)
False
>>> is_leaf(branches(t)[0])
True
```

Tree-recursive functions can be used to construct trees. For example, the nth Fibonacci tree has a root label of the nth Fibonacci number and, for `n > 1`, two branches that are also Fibonacci trees. A Fibonacci tree illustrates the tree-recursive computation of a Fibonacci number.

```
>>> def fib_tree(n):
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return tree(n)
        else:
            left, right = fib_tree(n-2), fib_tree(n-1)
            fib_n = label(left) + label(right)
            return tree(fib_n, [left, right])
>>> fib_tree(5)
[5, [2, [1], [1, [0], [1]]], [3, [1, [0], [1]], [2, [1], [1, [0], [1]]]]]
```

Tree-recursive functions are also used to process trees. For example, the `count_leaves` function counts the leaves of a tree.

```
>>> def count_leaves(tree):
      if is_leaf(tree):
          return 1
      else:
          branch_counts = [count_leaves(b) for b in branches(tree)]
          return sum(branch_counts)
>>> count_leaves(fib_tree(5))
8
```

**Partition trees.** Trees can also be used to represent the partitions of an integer. A partition tree for `n` using parts up to size `m` is a binary (two branch) tree that represents the choices taken during computation. In a non-leaf partition tree:

- the left (index 0) branch contains all ways of partitioning `n` using at least one `m`,
- the right (index 1) branch contains partitions using parts up to `m-1`, and
- the root label is `m`.

The labels at the leaves of a partition tree express whether the path from the root of the tree to the leaf represents a successful partition of `n`.

```
>>> def partition_tree(n, m):
        """Return a partition tree of n using parts of up to m."""
        if n == 0:
            return tree(True)
        elif n < 0 or m == 0:
            return tree(False)
        else:
            left = partition_tree(n-m, m)
            right = partition_tree(n, m-1)
            return tree(m, [left, right])
>>> partition_tree(2, 2)
[2, [True], [1, [1, [True], [False]], [False]]]
```

Printing the partitions from a partition tree is another tree-recursive process that traverses the tree, constructing each partition as a list. Whenever a `True` leaf is reached, the partition is printed.

```
>>> def print_parts(tree, partition=[]):
        if is_leaf(tree):
            if label(tree):
                print(' + '.join(partition))
        else:
            left, right = branches(tree)
            m = str(label(tree))
            print_parts(left, partition + [m])
            print_parts(right, partition)
>>> print_parts(partition_tree(6, 4))
4 + 2
4 + 1 + 1
3 + 3
3 + 2 + 1
3 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```

Slicing can be used on the branches of a tree as well. For example, we may want to place a restriction on the number of branches in a tree. A **binary tree** is either a leaf or a sequence of at most two binary trees. A common tree transformation called ***binarization*** computes a binary tree from an original tree by grouping together adjacent branches.

```
>>> def right_binarize(tree):
        """Construct a right-branching binary tree."""
        if is_leaf(tree):
            return tree
        if len(tree) > 2:
            tree = [tree[0], tree[1:]]
        return [right_binarize(b) for b in tree]
>>> right_binarize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
[1, [2, [3, [4, [5, [6, 7]]]]]]
```

### Trees

some recursive functions build up their result by **manipulating the return value** of a recursive call
other recursive functions build up their results by **passing information into the recursive call as an argument** (tail recursion)
and both of these strategies are useful when processing trees

```python
# Slicing

odds = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
list(range(1, 3))
[odds[i] for i in range(1, 3)]
odds[1:3]
odds[1:]
odds[:3]
odds[:]

# Aggregation

sum(odds)
sum({3:9, 5:25})
max(range(10))
max(range(10), key=lambda x: 7 - (x-2)*(x-4))
all([x < 5 for x in range(5)])
perfect_square = lambda x: x == round(x ** 0.5) ** 2
any([perfect_square(x) for x in range(50, 60)]) # Try ,65)

# Trees

def tree(label, branches=[]):
    for branch in branches:
        assert is_tree(branch), 'branches must be trees'
    return [label] + list(branches)

def label(tree):
    return tree[0]

def branches(tree):
    return tree[1:]

    if type(tree) != list or len(tree) < 1:
        return False

            return False

### 2.3.7 Linked Lists

## 2.4 Mutable Data

We have seen how abstraction is vital in helping us to cope with the complexity of large systems. **Effective programming also requires organizational principles that can guide us in formulating the overall design of a program. In particular, we need strategies to help us structure large systems to be modular, meaning that they divide naturally into coherent parts that can be separately developed and maintained.**

**One powerful technique for creating modular programs is to incorporate data that may change state over time. In this way, a single data object can represent something that evolves independently of the rest of the program.** The behavior of a changing object may be influenced by its history, just like an entity in the world. **Adding state to data is a central ingredient of a paradigm called object-oriented programming.**

### 2.4.1 The Object Metaphor

> a blueprint for a house is the class. that is the sort of the definition of the data I'm storing and the functionality of it
> and then i can instantiate i can create as many of those objects as i want. so they're essentially realizations
> of the thing that you've created.
> so the class is just sort of like a definition nothing exists 
> and then when you create an object, well now i can sort of do things with it.

In the beginning of this text, we distinguished between functions and data: **functions performed operations and data were operated upon.** When we included function values among our data, we acknowledged that data too can have behavior. Functions could be manipulated as data, but could also be called to perform computation.

***Objects*** combine data values with behavior. Objects represent information, but also ***behave*** like the things that they represent. The logic of how an object interacts with other objects is bundled along with the information that encodes the object's value. When an object is printed, it knows how to spell itself out in text. If an object is composed of parts, it knows how to reveal those parts on demand. **Objects are both information and processes, bundled together to represent the properties, interactions, and behaviors of complex things.**

Object behavior is implemented in Python through specialized object syntax and associated terminology, which we can introduce by example. A date is a kind of object.

```
>>> from datetime import date
```

The name `date` is bound to a ***class***. As we have seen, a class represents a kind of value. Individual dates are called ***instances*** of that class. <u>Instances can be ***constructed*** by calling the class on arguments that characterize the instance.</u>

```
>>> tues = date(2014, 5, 13)
```

While `tues` was constructed from primitive numbers, it behaves like a date. For instance, subtracting it from another date will give a time difference, which we can print.

```
>>> print(date(2014, 5, 19) - tues)
6 days, 0:00:00
```

Objects have ***attributes***, which are named values that are part of the object. In Python, like many other programming languages, we use **dot notation** to designated an attribute of an object.

> <expression> . <name>

Above, the `<expression>` evaluates to an object, and `<name>` is the name of an attribute for that object.

Unlike the names that we have considered so far, these attribute names are not available in the general environment. Instead, **attribute names are particular to the object instance preceding the dot**.

```
>>> tues.year
2014
```

Objects also have ***methods***, which are <u>function-valued attributes</u>. Metaphorically, we say that the object "knows" how to carry out those methods. By implementation, **methods are functions that compute their results from both their arguments and their object.** For example, The `strftime` method (a classic function name meant to evoke "string format of time") of `tues` takes a single argument that specifies how to display a date (e.g., `%A` means that the day of the week should be spelled out in full).

```
>>> tues.strftime('%A, %B %d')
'Tuesday, May 13'
```

Computing the return value  of `strftime` requires two inputs: the string that describes the format of the output and the date information bundled into `tues`. Date-specific logic is applied within this method to yield this result. We never stated that the 13th of May, 2014, was a Tuesday, but knowing the corresponding weekday is part of what it means to be a date. By bundling behavior and information together, this Python object offers us a convincing, self-contained abstraction of a date.

Dates are objects, but numbers, strings, lists, and ranges are all objects as well. They represent values, but also behave in a manner that befits the values they represent. They also have attributes and methods. For instance, strings have an array of methods that facilitate text processing.

```
>>> '1234'.isnumeric()
True
>>> 'rOBERT dE nIRO'.swapcase()
'Robert De Niro'
>>> 'eyes'.upper().endswith('YES')
True
```

In fact, **all values in Python are objects**. That is, all values have behavior and attributes. They act like the values they represent.

### 2.4.2 Sequence Objects

Instances of primitive built-in values such as numbers are ***immutable***. The values themselves cannot change over the course of program execution. Lists on the other hand are ***mutable***.

> immutable: number, strings, tuples
>
> mutable: lists dictionaries (and sets) 

Mutable objects are used to represent values that change over time. A person is the same person from one day to the next, despite having aged, received a haircut, or otherwise changed in some way. Similarly, an object may have changing properties due to ***mutating*** operations. For example,  it is possible to change the contents of a list. Most changes are performed by invoking methods on list objects.

We can introduce many list modification operations through an example that illustrates the history of playing cards (drastically simplified). Comments in the examples describe the effect of each method invocation.

Playing cards were invented in China, perhaps around the 9th century. An early deck had three suits, which corresponded to denominations of money.

```
>>> chinese = ['coin', 'string', 'myriad']  # A list literal
>>> suits = chinese                         # Two names refer to the same list
```

As cards migrated to Europe (perhaps through Egypt), only the suit of coins remained in Spanish decks (*oro*).

```
>>> suits.pop()             # Remove and return the final element
'myriad'
>>> suits.remove('string')  # Remove the first element that equals the argument
```

Three more suits were added (they evolved in name and design over time),

```
>>> suits.append('cup')              # Add an element to the end
>>> suits.extend(['sword', 'club'])  # Add all elements of a sequence to the end
```

and Italians called swords *spades*.

```
>>> suits[2] = 'spade'  # Replace an element
```

giving the suits of a traditional Italian deck of cards.

```
>>> suits
['coin', 'cup', 'spade', 'club']
```

The French variant used today in the U.S. changes the first two suits:

```
>>> suits[0:2] = ['heart', 'diamond']  # Replace a slice
>>> suits
['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
```

Methods also exist for inserting, sorting, and reversing lists. **All of these mutation operations change the value of the list; they do not create new list objects.**

**Sharing and Identity.** Because we have been changing a single list rather than creating new lists, the object bound to the name `chinese` has also changed, because it is the same list object that was bound to `suits`!

```
>>> chinese  # This name co-refers with "suits" to the same changing list
['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
```

This behavior is new. Previously, if a name did not appear in a statement, then its value would not be affected by that statement. <u>With mutable data, methods called on one name can affect another name at the same time.</u>

The environment diagram for this example shows how the value bound to `chinese` is changed by statements involving only `suits`. Step through each line of the following example to observe these changes.

![image-20211124155037068](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211124155037068.png)

Lists can be copied using the `list` constructor function. Changes to one list do not affect another, unless they share structure.

```
>>> nest = list(suits)  # Bind "nest" to a second list with the same elements
>>> nest[0] = suits     # Create a nested list
```

According to this environment, **changing the list referenced by `suits` will affect the nested list that is the first element of `nest`, but not the other elements.**

```
>>> suits.insert(2, 'Joker')  # Insert an element at index 2, shifting the rest
>>> nest
[['heart', 'diamond', 'Joker', 'spade', 'club'], 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
```

And likewise, undoing this change in the first element of `nest` will change `suit` as well.

```
>>> nest[0].pop(2)
'Joker'
>>> suits
['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
```

Stepping through this example line by line will show the representation of a nested list.

![image-20211124155444148](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211124155444148.png)

Because two lists may have the same contents but in fact be different lists, we require a means to test whether two objects are the same. Python includes two comparison operators, called **`is`** and **`is not`**, that test whether two expressions in fact evaluate to the identical object. **Two objects are identical if they are equal in their current value, and any change to one will always be reflected in the other.** **<u>Identity is a stronger condition than equality.</u>**

```
>>> suits is nest[0]
True
>>> suits is ['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
False
>>> suits == ['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
True
```

The final two comparisons illustrate the difference between `is` and `==`. The former checks for **identity**, while the latter checks for the **equality of contents**.

**List comprehensions.** A list comprehension always creates a new list. For example, the `unicodedata` module tracks the official names of every character in the Unicode alphabet. We can look up the characters corresponding to names, including those for card suits.

```
>>> from unicodedata import lookup
>>> [lookup('WHITE ' + s.upper() + ' SUIT') for s in suits]
['♡', '♢', '♤', '♧']
```

This resulting list does not share any of its contents with `suits`, and evaluating the list comprehension does not modify the `suits` list.

You can read more about the Unicode standard for representing text in the [Unicode section](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/strings.html#one-ring-to-rule-them-all) of Dive into Python 3.

**Tuples.** A tuple, an instance of the built-in `tuple` type, is an immutable sequence. Tuples are created using a tuple literal that separates element expressions by commas. **Parentheses are optional but used commonly in practice.** Any objects can be placed within tuples.

```
>>> 1, 2 + 3
(1, 5)
>>> ("the", 1, ("and", "only"))
('the', 1, ('and', 'only'))
>>> type( (10, 20) )
<class 'tuple'>
```

**Empty and one-element tuples have special literal syntax.**

```
>>> ()    # 0 elements
()
>>> (10,) # 1 element
(10,)
```

Like lists, tuples have a finite length and support element selection. They also have a few methods that are also available for lists, such as `count` and `index`.

```
>>> code = ("up", "up", "down", "down") + ("left", "right") * 2
>>> len(code)
8
>>> code[3]
'down'
>>> code.count("down")
2
>>> code.index("left")
4
```

However, the methods for manipulating the contents of a list are not available for tuples because tuples are immutable.

While it is not possible to change which elements are in a tuple, it is possible to change the value of a mutable element contained within a tuple.

Tuples are used implicitly in multiple assignment. **An assignment of two values to two names creates a two-element tuple and then unpacks it.**

![image-20211125145928074](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211125145928074.png)

use plus equals operator on list, something weird happens

so i almost never use this construction

### 2.4.3 Dictionaries

Dictionaries are Python's built-in data type for storing and manipulating correspondence relationships. A dictionary contains key-value pairs, where both the keys and values are objects. **The purpose of a dictionary is to provide an abstraction for storing and retrieving values that are indexed not by consecutive integers, but by descriptive keys.**

Strings commonly serve as keys, because strings are our conventional representation for names of things. This dictionary literal gives the values of various Roman numerals.

```
>>> numerals = {'I': 1.0, 'V': 5, 'X': 10}
```

Looking up values by their keys uses the element selection operator that we previously applied to sequences.

```
>>> numerals['X']
10
```

A dictionary can have at most one value for each key. Adding new key-value pairs and changing the existing value for a key can both be achieved with assignment statements.

```
>>> numerals['I'] = 1
>>> numerals['L'] = 50
>>> numerals
{'I': 1, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'V': 5}
```

Notice that `'L'` was not added to the end of the output above. Dictionaries are **unordered** collections of key-value pairs. When we print a dictionary, the keys and values are rendered in some order, but as users of the language we cannot predict what that order will be. The order may change when running a program multiple times.

Dictionaries can appear in environment diagrams as well.

![image-20211124162533320](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211124162533320.png)

The dictionary type also supports various methods of iterating over the contents of the dictionary as a whole. **The methods `keys`, `values`, and `items` all return iterable values.**

```
>>> sum(numerals.values())
66
```

A list of key-value pairs can be converted into a dictionary by calling the **`dict` constructor function**.

```
>>> dict([(3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)])
{3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

Dictionaries do have some restrictions:

- **A key of a dictionary cannot be or contain a mutable value.**
- **There can be at most one value for a given key.**

This first restriction is tied to the underlying implementation of dictionaries in Python. The details of this implementation are not a topic of this text. Intuitively, consider that the key tells Python where to find that key-value pair in memory; if the key changes, the location of the pair may be lost. Tuples are commonly used for keys in dictionaries because lists cannot be used.

The second restriction is a consequence of the dictionary abstraction, which is designed to store and retrieve values for keys. We can only retrieve *the* value for a key if at most one such value exists in the dictionary.

A useful method implemented by dictionaries is **`get`**, which returns either the value for a key, if the key is present, or a default value. The arguments to `get` are the key and the default value.

```
>>> numerals.get('A', 0)
0
>>> numerals.get('V', 0)
5
```

Dictionaries also have a comprehension syntax analogous to those of lists. A key expression and a value expression are separated by a colon. Evaluating a dictionary comprehension creates a new dictionary object.

```
>>> {x: x*x for x in range(3,6)}
{3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

### 2.4.4 Local State

Lists and dictionaries have ***local state***: they are changing values that have some particular contents at any point in the execution of a program. The word "state" implies an evolving process in which that state may change.

Functions can also have local state. For instance, let us define a function that models the process of withdrawing money from a bank account. We will create a function called `withdraw`, which takes as its argument an amount to be withdrawn. If there is enough money in the account to accommodate the withdrawal, then `withdraw` will return the balance remaining after the withdrawal. Otherwise, `withdraw` will return the message `'Insufficient funds'`. For example, if we begin with $100 in the account, we would like to obtain the following sequence of return values by calling withdraw:

```
>>> withdraw(25)
75
>>> withdraw(25)
50
>>> withdraw(60)
'Insufficient funds'
>>> withdraw(15)
35
```

Above, the expression `withdraw(25)`, evaluated twice, yields different values. Thus, this user-defined function is non-pure. Calling the function not only returns a value, but also has the side effect of changing the function in some way, so that the next call with the same argument will return a different result. This side effect is a result of `withdraw` making a change to a name-value binding outside of the current frame.

For `withdraw` to make sense, it must be created with an initial account balance. The function `make_withdraw` is a higher-order function that takes a starting balance as an argument. The function `withdraw` is its return value.

```
>>> withdraw = make_withdraw(100)
```

An implementation of `make_withdraw` requires a new kind of statement: a **`nonlocal`** statement. When we call `make_withdraw`, we bind the name `balance` to the initial amount. We then define and return a local function, `withdraw`, which updates and returns the value of `balance` when called.

```
>>> def make_withdraw(balance):
        """Return a withdraw function that draws down balance with each call."""
        def withdraw(amount):
            nonlocal balance                 # Declare the name "balance" nonlocal
            if amount > balance:
                return 'Insufficient funds'
            balance = balance - amount       # Re-bind the existing balance name
            return balance
        return withdraw
```

**The `nonlocal` statement declares that whenever we change the binding of the name `balance`, the binding is changed in the first frame in which `balance` is already bound.** Recall that without the `nonlocal` statement, an assignment statement would always bind a name in the first frame of the current environment. The `nonlocal` statement indicates that the name appears somewhere in the environment other than the first (local) frame or the last (global) frame.

The following environment diagrams illustrate the effects of multiple calls to a function created by `make_withdraw`.

![image-20211125151132996](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211125151132996.png)

The first def statement has the usual effect: it creates a new user-defined function and binds the name `make_withdraw` to that function in the global frame. The subsequent call to `make_withdraw` creates and returns a locally defined function `withdraw`. The name `balance` is bound in the parent frame of this function. Crucially, there will only be this single binding for the name `balance` throughout the rest of this example.

Next, we evaluate an expression that calls this function, bound to the name `wd`, on an amount 5. The body of `withdraw` is executed in a new environment that extends the environment in which `withdraw` was defined. Tracing the effect of evaluating `withdraw` illustrates the effect of a `nonlocal` statement in Python: a name outside of the first local frame can be changed by an assignment statement.

The `nonlocal` statement changes all of the remaining assignment statements in the definition of `withdraw`. After executing `nonlocal balance`, any assignment statement with `balance` on the left-hand side of `=` will not bind `balance` in the first frame of the current environment. Instead, it will find the first frame in which `balance` was already defined and re-bind the name in that frame. If `balance` has not previously been bound to a value, then the `nonlocal` statement will give an error.

By virtue of changing the binding for `balance`, we have changed the `withdraw` function as well. The next time it is called, the name `balance` will evaluate to 15 instead of 20. Hence, when we call `withdraw` a second time, we see that its return value is 12 and not 17. The change to `balance` from the first call affects the result of the second call.

The second call to `withdraw` does create a second local frame, as usual. However, both `withdraw` frames have the same parent. That is, they both extend the environment for `make_withdraw`, which contains the binding for `balance`. Hence, they share that particular name binding. Calling `withdraw` has the side effect of altering the environment that will be extended by future calls to `withdraw`. The `nonlocal` statement allows `withdraw` to change a name binding in the `make_withdraw` frame.

Ever since we first encountered nested `def` statements, we have observed that a locally defined function can look up names outside of its local frames. No `nonlocal` statement is required to *access* a non-local name. By contrast, only after a `nonlocal` statement can a function *change* the binding of names in these frames.

By introducing `nonlocal` statements, we have created a dual role for assignment statements. **Either they change local bindings, or they change nonlocal bindings.** **In fact, assignment statements already had a dual role: they either created new bindings or re-bound existing names.** Assignment can also change the contents of lists and dictionaries. The many roles of Python assignment can obscure the effects of executing an assignment statement. It is up to you as a programmer to document your code clearly so that the effects of assignment can be understood by others.

**Python Particulars.** This pattern of non-local assignment is a general feature of programming languages with higher-order functions and lexical scope. Most other languages do not require a `nonlocal` statement at all. Instead, non-local assignment is often the default behavior of assignment statements.

Python also has an unusual restriction regarding the lookup of names: within the body of a function, all instances of a name must refer to the same frame. As a result, Python cannot look up the value of a name in a non-local frame, then bind that same name in the local frame, because the same name would be accessed in two different frames in the same function. This restriction allows Python to pre-compute which frame contains each name before executing the body of a function. When this restriction is violated, a confusing error message results. To demonstrate, the `make_withdraw` example is repeated below with the `nonlocal` statement removed.

![image-20211125151252356](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211125151252356.png)

This `UnboundLocalError` appears because `balance` is assigned locally in line 5, and so Python assumes that all references to `balance` must appear in the local frame as well. This error occurs ***before*** line 5 is ever executed, implying that Python has considered line 5 in some way before executing line 3. As we study interpreter design, we will see that pre-computing facts about a function body before executing it is quite common. In this case, Python's pre-processing restricted the frame in which `balance` could appear, and thus prevented the name from being found. Adding a `nonlocal` statement corrects this error. The `nonlocal` statement did not exist in Python 2.

### 2.4.5 The Benefits of Non-Local Assignment

Non-local assignment is an important step on our path to viewing a program as a collection of independent and autonomous ***objects***, which interact with each other but each manage their own internal state.

**In particular, non-local assignment has given us the ability to maintain some state that is local to a function, but evolves over successive calls to that function.** The `balance` associated with a particular withdraw function is shared among all calls to that function. However, the binding for balance associated with an instance of withdraw is inaccessible to the rest of the program. <u>Only `wd` is associated with the frame for `make_withdraw` in which it was defined. If `make_withdraw` is called again, then it will create a separate frame with a separate binding for `balance`.</u>

We can extend our example to illustrate this point. A second call to `make_withdraw` returns a second `withdraw` function that has a different parent. We bind this second function to the name `wd2` in the global frame.

![image-20211125151545507](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211125151545507.png)

Now, we see that there are in fact two bindings for the name `balance` in two different frames, and each `withdraw` function has a different parent. The name `wd` is bound to a function with a balance of 20, while `wd2` is bound to a different function with a balance of 7.

Calling `wd2` changes the binding of its non-local `balance` name, but does not affect the function bound to the name `withdraw`. A future call to `wd` is unaffected by the changing balance of `wd2`; its balance is still 20.

![image-20211125151632154](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211125151632154.png)

**In this way, each instance of `withdraw` maintains its own balance state, but that state is inaccessible to any other function in the program.** Viewing this situation at a higher level, we have created an abstraction of a bank account that manages its own internals but behaves in a way that models accounts in the world: it changes over time based on its own history of withdrawal requests.

### 2.4.6 The Cost of Non-Local Assignment

**Our environment model of computation cleanly extends to explain the effects of non-local assignment.** However, non-local assignment introduces some important nuances in the way we think about names and values.

Previously, our values did not change; only our names and bindings changed. When two names `a` and `b` were both bound to the value 4, it did not matter whether they were bound to the same 4 or different 4's. As far as we could tell, there was only one 4 object that never changed.

However, **functions with state do not behave this way**. When two names `wd` and `wd2` are both bound to a `withdraw` function, it *does* matter whether they are bound to the same function or different instances of that function. Consider the following example, which contrasts the one we just analyzed. In this case, calling the function named by `wd2` did change the value of the function named by `wd`, because both names refer to the same function.

![image-20211125151735909](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211125151735909.png)

It is not unusual for two names to co-refer to the same value in the world, and so it is in our programs. But, as values change over time, we must be very careful to understand the effect of a change on other names that might refer to those values.

The key to correctly analyzing code with non-local assignment is to remember that only function calls can introduce new frames. Assignment statements always change bindings in existing frames. In this case, unless `make_withdraw` is called twice, there can be only one binding for `balance`.

**Sameness and change.** These subtleties arise because, by introducing non-pure functions that change the non-local environment, we have changed the nature of expressions. An expression that contains only pure function calls is ***referentially transparent***; its value does not change if we substitute one of its subexpression with the value of that subexpression.

**Re-binding operations violate the conditions of referential transparency because they do more than return a value; they change the environment.** When we introduce arbitrary re-binding, we encounter a thorny epistemological issue: what it means for two values to be the same. In our environment model of computation, two separately defined functions are not the same, because changes to one may not be reflected in the other.

**In general, so long as we never modify data objects, we can regard a compound data object to be precisely the totality of its pieces. For example, a rational number is determined by giving its numerator and its denominator. But this view is no longer valid in the presence of change, where a compound data object has an "identity" that is something different from the pieces of which it is composed. A bank account is still "the same" bank account even if we change the balance by making a withdrawal; conversely, we could have two bank accounts that happen to have the same balance, but are different objects.**

**Despite the complications it introduces, non-local assignment is a powerful tool for creating modular programs. Different parts of a program, which correspond to different environment frames, can evolve separately throughout program execution. Moreover, using functions with local state, we are able to implement mutable data types. In fact, we can implement abstract data types that are equivalent to the built-in `list` and `dict` types introduced above.**

### Mutable Functions

def make_withdraw(balance):
    """Return a withdraw function with a starting balance."""
    def withdraw(amount):
        nonlocal balance
        if amount > balance:
            return 'Insufficient funds'
        balance = balance - amount
        return balance
    return withdraw

def make_withdraw_list(balance):
    b = [balance]
    def withdraw(amount):
        if amount > b[0]:
            return 'Insufficient funds'
        b[0] = b[0] - amount
        return b[0]
    return withdraw

def f(x):
    x = 4
    def g(y):
        def h(z):
            nonlocal x
            x = x + 1
            return x + y + z
        return h
    return g
a = f(1)
b = a(2)
b(3) + b(4)

## 4.2 Implicit Sequences

A sequence can be represented without each element being stored explicitly in the memory of the computer. That is, we can construct an object that provides access to all of the elements of some sequential dataset without computing the value of each element in advance. Instead, we compute elements on demand.

An example of this idea arises in the `range` container type introduced in Chapter 2. A `range` represents a consecutive, bounded sequence of integers. However, it is not the case that each element of that sequence is represented explicitly in memory. Instead, when an element is requested from a `range`, it is computed. Hence, we can represent very large ranges of integers without using large blocks of memory. Only the end points of the range are stored as part of the `range` object.

```
>>> r = range(10000, 1000000000)
>>> r[45006230]
45016230
```

In this example, not all 999,990,000 integers in this range are stored when the range instance is constructed. Instead, the range object adds the first element 10,000 to the index 45,006,230 to produce the element 45,016,230. Computing values on demand, rather than retrieving them from an existing representation, is an example of *lazy* computation. In computer science, ***lazy computation*** <u>describes any program that delays the computation of a value until that value is needed.</u>

### 4.2.1 Iterators

Python and many other programming languages provide a unified way to process elements of a container value sequentially, called an iterator. An ***iterator*** is an object that provides sequential access to values, one by one.

The iterator abstraction has two components: <u>a mechanism for retrieving the next element in the sequence being processed and a mechanism for signaling that the end of the sequence has been reached and no further elements remain.</u> For any container, such as a list or range, an iterator can be obtained by calling the built-in `iter` function. The contents of the iterator can be accessed by calling the built-in `next` function.

```
>>> primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
>>> type(primes)
>>> iterator = iter(primes)
>>> type(iterator)
>>> next(iterator)
2
>>> next(iterator)
3
>>> next(iterator)
5
```

The way that Python signals that there are no more values available is to raise a `StopIteration` exception when `next` is called. This exception can be handled using a `try` statement.

```
>>> next(iterator)
7
>>> next(iterator)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
>>> try:
        next(iterator)
    except StopIteration:
        print('No more values')
No more values
```

An iterator maintains local state to represent its position in a sequence. Each time `next` is called, that position advances. Two separate iterators can track two different positions in the same sequence. However, two names for the same iterator will share a position, because they share the same value.

```
>>> r = range(3, 13)
>>> s = iter(r)  # 1st iterator over r
>>> next(s)
3
>>> next(s)
4
>>> t = iter(r)  # 2nd iterator over r
>>> next(t)
3
>>> next(t)
4
>>> u = t        # Alternate name for the 2nd iterator
>>> next(u)
5
>>> next(u)
6
```

Advancing the second iterator does not affect the first. Since the last value returned from the first iterator was 4, it is positioned to return 5 next. On the other hand, the second iterator is positioned to return 7 next.

```
>>> next(s)
5
>>> next(t)
7
```

**Calling `iter` on an iterator will return that iterator, not a copy.** This behavior is included in Python so that a programmer can call `iter` on a value to get an iterator without having to worry about whether it is an iterator or a container.

```
>>> v = iter(t)  # Another alterante name for the 2nd iterator
>>> next(v)
8
>>> next(u)
9
>>> next(t)
10
```

The usefulness of iterators is derived from the fact that the underlying series of data for an iterator may not be represented explicitly in memory. An iterator provides a mechanism for considering each of a series of values in turn, but all of those elements do not need to be stored simultaneously. Instead, when the next element is requested from an iterator, that element may be computed on demand instead of being retrieved from an existing memory source.

Ranges are able to compute the elements of a sequence lazily because the sequence represented is uniform, and any element is easy to compute from the starting and ending bounds of the range. Iterators allow for lazy generation of a much broader class of underlying sequential datasets, because <u>they do not need to provide access to arbitrary elements of the underlying series. Instead, iterators are only required to compute the next element of the series</u>, in order, each time another element is requested. While not as flexible as accessing arbitrary elements of a sequence (called ***random access***), ***sequential access*** to sequential data is often sufficient for data processing applications.

```python
def iterator_demos():
    """Using iterators

    >>> s = [[1, 2], 3, 4, 5]
    >>> next(s)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: 'list' object is not an iterator
    >>> t = iter(s)
    >>> next(t)
    [1, 2]
    >>> next(t)
    3
    >>> u = iter(s)
    >>> next(u)
    [1, 2]
    >>> list(t)
    [4, 5]
    >>> next(t)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    StopIteration
    >>> d = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3} # Keys and values
    >>> k = iter(d) # next(k)
    >>> v = iter(d.values()) # next(v)
    >>> k = iter(d)
    >>> d.pop('two')
    2
    >>> next(k)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration

```

### 4.2.2  Iterables

Any value that can produce iterators is called an ***iterable*** value. In Python, an iterable value is anything that can be passed to the built-in `iter` function. Iterables include sequence values such as strings and tuples, as well as other containers such as sets and dictionaries. Iterators are also iterables, because they can be passed to the `iter` function.

Even unordered collections such as dictionaries must define an ordering over their contents when they produce iterators. Dictionaries and sets are unordered because the programmer has no control over the order of iteration, but Python does guarantee certain properties about their order in its specification.

```
>>> d = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
>>> d
{'one': 1, 'three': 3, 'two': 2}
>>> k = iter(d)
>>> next(k)
'one'
>>> next(k)
'three'
>>> v = iter(d.values())
>>> next(v)
1
>>> next(v)
3
```

If a dictionary changes in structure because **a key is added or removed,** then all iterators become invalid and future iterators may exhibit arbitrary changes to the order their contents. On the other hand, **changing the value of an existing key does not change the order of the contents or invalidate iterators.**

```
>>> d.pop('two')
2
>>> next(k)
Traceback (most recent call last):

RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
```

### 4.2.3  Built-in Iterators

Several built-in functions take as arguments iterable values and return iterators. These functions are used extensively for lazy sequence processing.

The `map` function is lazy: calling it does not perform the computation required to compute elements of its result. Instead, an iterator object is created that can return results if queried using `next`. We can observe this fact in the following example, in which the call to `print` is delayed until the corresponding element is requested from the `doubled` iterator.

```
>>> def double_and_print(x):
        print('***', x, '=>', 2*x, '***')
        return 2*x
>>> s = range(3, 7)
>>> doubled = map(double_and_print, s)  # double_and_print not yet called
>>> next(doubled)                       # double_and_print called once
*** 3 => 6 ***
6
>>> next(doubled)                       # double_and_print called again
*** 4 => 8 ***
8
>>> list(doubled)                       # double_and_print called twice more
*** 5 => 10 ***
*** 6 => 12 ***
[10, 12]
```

The `filter` function returns an iterator over, `zip`, and `reversed` functions also return iterators.

```python
def double(x):
    print('***', x, '=>', 2*x, '***')
    return 2*x

	# built_in_demo
    # Using built-in sequence functions.

    >>> bcd = ['b', 'c', 'd']
    >>> [x.upper() for x in bcd]
    ['B', 'C', 'D']
    >>> caps = map(lambda x: x.upper(), bcd)
    >>> next(caps)
    'B'
    >>> next(caps)
    'C'
    >>> s = range(3, 7)
    >>> doubled = map(double, s)
    >>> next(doubled)
    *** 3 => 6 ***
    6
    >>> next(doubled)
    *** 4 => 8 ***
    8
    >>> list(doubled)
    *** 5 => 10 ***
    *** 6 => 12 ***
    [10, 12]
    >>> f = lambda x: x < 10
    >>> a = filter(f, map(double, reversed(s)))
    >>> list(a)
    *** 6 => 12 ***
    *** 5 => 10 ***
    *** 4 => 8 ***
    *** 3 => 6 ***
    [8, 6]
    >>> t = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
    >>> reversed(t) == t
    False
    >>> list(reversed(t)) == t
    True
    >>> d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    >>> items = zip(d.keys(), d.values()) # Call next(items)
```

```python
# Zip

def palindrome(s):
    """Return whether s is the same sequence backward and forward.

    >>> palindrome([3, 1, 4, 1, 5])
    False
    >>> palindrome([3, 1, 4, 1, 3])
    True
    >>> palindrome('seveneves')
    True
    >>> palindrome('seven eves')
    False
    """
    # return s == reversed(s)  # This version doesn't work 
    return all([a == b for a, b in zip(s, reversed(s))])
    return list(s) == list(reversed(s))
```

### 4.2.4  For Statements

The `for` statement in Python operates on iterators. Objects are *iterable* (an interface) if they have an `__iter__` method that returns an *iterator*. Iterable objects can be the value of the `<expression>` in the header of a `for` statement:

```
for <name> in <expression>:
    <suite>
```

```python
    # Demo
    >>> r = range(3, 6)
    >>> s = iter(r)
    >>> next(s)
    3
    >>> for x in s:
    ... print(x)
    4
    5
    >>> for x in s:
    ... print(x)
    >>> for x in r:
    ... print(x)
    3
    4
    5
    >>> for x in r:
    ... print(x)
    3
    4
    5
    """
```

def gamble(strategy, hands=1000):
    return sum([blackjack(strategy, shhh) for _ in range(hands)])
```

### 4.2.5  Generators and Yield Statements

Generators allow us to define more complicated iterations by leveraging the features of the Python interpreter.

A *generator* is an iterator returned by a special class of function called a ***generator function***. Generator functions are distinguished from regular functions in that rather than containing `return` statements in their body, they use **`yield` statement** to return elements of a series.

Generators do not use attributes of an object to track their progress through a series. Instead, they control the execution of the generator function, which runs until the next `yield` statement is executed each time the generator's `__next__` method is invoked.

The generator does not start executing any of the body statements of its generator function until the first time `__next__` is invoked. The generator raises a `StopIteration` exception whenever its generator function returns.

```python
def plus_minus(x):
    """Yield x and -x.

    >>> t = plus_minus(3)
    >>> next(t)
    3
    >>> next(t)
    -3
    >>> list(plus_minus(5))
    [5, -5]
    >>> list(map(abs, plus_minus(7)))
    [7, 7]

    yield x
    yield -x

## 2.5 Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method for organizing programs that brings together many of the ideas introduced in this chapter. Like the functions in data abstraction, **classes create abstraction barriers between the use and implementation of data.** Like dispatch dictionaries, objects respond to behavioral requests. Like mutable data structures, objects have local state that is not directly accessible from the global environment. The Python object system provides convenient syntax to promote the use of these techniques for organizing programs. Much of this syntax is shared among other object-oriented programming languages.

The object system offers more than just convenience. **It enables a new metaphor for designing programs in which several independent agents interact within the computer.** Each object bundles together <u>local state and behavior</u> in a way that abstracts the complexity of both. Objects communicate with each other, and useful results are computed as a consequence of their interaction. Not only do objects pass messages, they also share behavior among other objects of the same type and inherit characteristics from related types.

The paradigm of object-oriented programming has its own vocabulary that supports the object metaphor. We have seen that an object is a data value that has methods and attributes, accessible via dot notation. Every object also has a type, called its ***class***. To create new types of data, we implement new classes.

### 2.5.1 Objects and Classes

A class serves as a template for all objects whose type is that class. Every object is an instance of some particular class. The objects we have used so far all have built-in classes, but new user-defined classes can be created as well. A class definition specifies the attributes and methods shared among objects of that class. We will introduce the class statement by revisiting the example of a bank account.

When introducing local state, we saw that bank accounts are naturally modeled as mutable values that have a `balance`. A bank account object should have a `withdraw` method that updates the account balance and returns the requested amount, if it is available. To complete the abstraction: a bank account should be able to return its current `balance`, return the name of the account `holder`, and an amount for `deposit`.

An `Account` class allows us to create multiple instances of bank accounts. The act of creating a new object instance is known as *instantiating* the class. The syntax in Python for instantiating a class is identical to the syntax of calling a function. In this case, we call `Account` with the argument `'Kirk'`, the account holder's name.

```
>>> a = Account('Kirk')
```

An ***attribute*** of an object is a **name-value pair associated with the object**, which is accessible via dot notation. The attributes specific to a particular object, as opposed to all objects of a class, are called ***instance attributes***. Each `Account` has its own balance and account holder name, which are examples of instance attributes. In the broader programming community, instance attributes may also be called ***fields*, *properties*, or *instance variables***.

```
>>> a.holder
'Kirk'
>>> a.balance
0
```

Functions that operate on the object or perform object-specific computations are called **method**s. The return values and side effects of a method can depend upon and change other attributes of the object. For example, `deposit` is a method of our `Account` object `a`. It takes one argument, the amount to deposit, changes the `balance` attribute of the object, and returns the resulting balance.

```
>>> a.deposit(15)
15
```

We say that methods are ***invoked*** on a particular object. As a result of invoking the `withdraw` method, either the withdrawal is approved and the amount is deducted, or the request is declined and the method returns an error message.

```
>>> a.withdraw(10)  # The withdraw method returns the balance after withdrawal
5
>>> a.balance       # The balance attribute has changed
5
>>> a.withdraw(10)
'Insufficient funds'
```

As illustrated above, the behavior of a method can depend upon the changing attributes of the object. Two calls to `withdraw` with the same argument return different results.

### 2.5.2  Defining Classes

User-defined classes are created by `class` statements, which consist of a single clause. A class statement defines the class name, then includes a suite of statements to define the attributes of the class:

```
class <name>:
    <suite>
```

When a class statement is executed, <u>a new class is created and bound to `<name>` in the first frame of the current environment.</u> <u>The suite is then executed.</u> Any names bound within the `<suite>`  of a `class` statement, through `def` or assignment statements, <u>create or modify attributes of the class</u>.

Classes are typically organized around manipulating instance attributes, which are the name-value pairs associated with each instance of that class. The class specifies the instance attributes of its objects by defining a method for initializing new objects. For example, part of initializing an object of the `Account` class is to assign it a starting balance of 0.

The `<suite>` of a `class` statement contains `def` statements that define new methods for objects of that class. The method that initializes objects has a special name in Python, **`__init__`** (two underscores on each side of the word "init"), and is called the ***constructor*** for the class.

```
>>> class Account:
        def __init__(self, account_holder):
            self.balance = 0
            self.holder = account_holder
```

The `__init__` method for `Account` has two formal parameters. The first one, **`self`, is bound to the newly created `Account` object.** The second parameter, `account_holder`, <u>is bound to the argument passed to the class when it is called to be instantiated.</u>

The constructor binds the instance attribute name `balance` to 0. It also binds the attribute name `holder` to the value of the name `account_holder`. The formal parameter `account_holder` is a local name in the `__init__` method. On the other hand, the name `holder` that is bound via the final assignment statement persists, because it is stored as **an attribute of `self` using dot notation**.

Having defined the `Account` class, we can instantiate it.

```
>>> a = Account('Kirk')
```

This "call" to the `Account` class creates a new object that is an instance of `Account`, then calls the constructor function `__init__` with two arguments: the newly created object and the string `'Kirk'`. **By convention, we use the parameter name `self` for the first argument of a constructor**, because it is bound to the object being instantiated. This convention is adopted in virtually all Python code.

Now, we can access the object's `balance` and `holder` using dot notation.

```
>>> a.balance
0
>>> a.holder
'Kirk'
```

**Identity.** Each new account instance has its own balance attribute, the value of which is independent of other objects of the same class.

```
>>> b = Account('Spock')
>>> b.balance = 200
>>> [acc.balance for acc in (a, b)]
[0, 200]
```

To enforce this separation, every object that is an instance of a user-defined class has a unique identity. Object identity is compared using the `is` and `is not` operators.

```
>>> a is a
True
>>> a is not b
True
```

Despite being constructed from identical calls, the objects bound to `a` and `b` are not the same. As usual, binding an object to a new name using assignment does not create a new object.

```
>>> c = a
>>> c is a
True
```

New objects that have user-defined classes are only created when a class (such as `Account`) is instantiated with call expression syntax.

**Methods.** Object methods are also defined by a `def` statement in the suite of a `class` statement. Below, `deposit` and `withdraw` are both defined as methods on objects of the `Account` class.

```
>>> class Account:
        def __init__(self, account_holder):
            self.balance = 0
            self.holder = account_holder
        def deposit(self, amount):
            self.balance = self.balance + amount
            return self.balance
        def withdraw(self, amount):
            if amount > self.balance:
                return 'Insufficient funds'
            self.balance = self.balance - amount
            return self.balance
```

While method definitions do not differ from function definitions in how they are declared, method definitions do have a different effect when executed. The function value that is created by a `def` statement within a `class` statement is bound to the declared name, but **bound locally within the class as an attribute.** That value is invoked as a method using dot notation from an instance of the class.

Each method definition again includes a special first parameter `self`, which is **bound to the object on which the method is invoked.** For example, let us say that `deposit` is invoked on a particular `Account` object and passed a single argument value: the amount deposited. The object itself is bound to `self`, while the argument is bound to `amount`. **All invoked methods have access to the object via the `self` parameter, and so they can all access and manipulate the object's state.**

To invoke these methods, we again use dot notation, as illustrated below.

```
>>> spock_account = Account('Spock')
>>> spock_account.deposit(100)
100
>>> spock_account.withdraw(90)
10
>>> spock_account.withdraw(90)
'Insufficient funds'
>>> spock_account.holder
'Spock'
```

When a method is invoked via dot notation, the object itself (bound to `spock_account`, in this case) plays a dual role. First, <u>it determines what the name `withdraw` means</u>; `withdraw` is not a name in the environment, but instead a name that is local to the `Account` class. Second, <u>it is bound to the first parameter `self` when the `withdraw` method is invoked</u>.

### 2.5.3 Message Passing and Dot Expressions

Methods, which are defined in classes, and instance attributes, which are typically assigned in constructors, are the fundamental elements of object-oriented programming. These two concepts replicate much of the behavior of a dispatch dictionary in a message passing implementation of a data value. Objects take messages using dot notation, but instead of those messages being arbitrary string-valued keys, they are names local to a class. Objects also have named local state values (the instance attributes), but that state can be accessed and manipulated using dot notation, without having to employ `nonlocal` statements in the implementation.

The central idea in message passing was that data values should have behavior by responding to messages that are relevant to the abstract type they represent. Dot notation is a syntactic feature of Python that formalizes the message passing metaphor. The advantage of using a language with a built-in object system is that message passing can interact seamlessly with other language features, such as assignment statements. We do not require different messages to "get" or "set" the value associated with a local attribute name; the language syntax allows us to use the message name directly.

**Dot expressions.** The code fragment `spock_account.deposit` is called a ***dot expression***. A dot expression consists of an expression, a dot, and a name:

```
<expression> . <name>
```

**The `<expression>` can be any valid Python expression, but the `<name>` must be a simple name (not an expression that evaluates to a name)**. A dot expression evaluates to the value of the attribute with the given `<name>`, for the object that is the value of the `<expression>`.

The built-in function **`getattr`** also returns an attribute for an object by name. It is the function equivalent of dot notation. Using `getattr`, we can look up an attribute using a string, just as we did with a dispatch dictionary.

```
>>> getattr(spock_account, 'balance')
10
```

We can also test whether an object has a named attribute with **`hasattr`.**

```
>>> hasattr(spock_account, 'deposit')
True
```

The attributes of an object include all of its instance attributes, along with all of the attributes (including methods) defined in its class. Methods are attributes of the class that require special handling.

**Methods and functions.** When a method is invoked on an object, that object is implicitly passed as the first argument to the method. That is, the object that is the value of the `<expression>` to the left of the dot is passed automatically as the first argument to the method named on the right side of the dot expression. As a result, the object is bound to the parameter `self`.

To achieve automatic `self` binding, Python distinguishes between *functions*, which we have been creating since the beginning of the text, and ***bound methods***, which couple together a function and the object on which that method will be invoked. A bound method value is already associated with its first argument, the instance on which it was invoked, which will be named `self` when the method is called.

We can see the difference in the interactive interpreter by calling `type` on the returned values of dot expressions. As an attribute of a class, a method is just a function, but as an attribute of an instance, it is a bound method:

```
>>> type(Account.deposit)
<class 'function'>
>>> type(spock_account.deposit)
<class 'method'>
```

These two results differ only in the fact that the first is a standard two-argument function with parameters `self` and `amount`. The second is a one-argument method, where the name `self` will be bound to the object named `spock_account` automatically when the method is called, while the parameter `amount` will be bound to the argument passed to the method. Both of these values, whether function values or bound method values, are associated with the same `deposit` function body.

We can call `deposit` in two ways: as a function and as a bound method. In the former case, we must supply an argument for the `self` parameter explicitly. In the latter case, the `self` parameter is bound automatically.

```
>>> Account.deposit(spock_account, 1001)  # The deposit function takes 2 arguments
1011
>>> spock_account.deposit(1000)           # The deposit method takes 1 argument
2011
```

The function `getattr` behaves exactly like dot notation: if its first argument is an object but the name is a method defined in the class, then `getattr` returns a bound method value. On the other hand, if the first argument is a class, then `getattr` returns the attribute value directly, which is a plain function.

**Naming Conventions.** Class names are conventionally written using the CapWords convention (also called CamelCase because the capital letters in the middle of a name look like humps). Method names follow the standard convention of naming functions using lowercased words separated by underscores.

In some cases, there are instance variables and methods that are related to the maintenance and consistency of an object that we don't want users of the object to see or use. They are not part of the abstraction defined by a class, but instead part of the implementation. Python's convention dictates that **if an attribute name starts with an underscore, it should only be accessed within methods of the class itself, rather than by users of the class.**

### 2.5.4 Class Attributes

Some attribute values are shared across all objects of a given class. Such attributes are associated with the class itself, rather than any individual instance of the class. For instance, let us say that a bank pays interest on the balance of accounts at a fixed interest rate. That interest rate may change, but it is a single value shared across all accounts.

**Class attributes are created by assignment statements in the suite of a `class` statement, outside of any method definition.** In the broader developer community, class attributes may also be called **class variables or static variables**. The following class statement creates a class attribute for `Account` with the name `interest`.

```
>>> class Account:
        interest = 0.02            # A class attribute
        def __init__(self, account_holder):
            self.balance = 0
            self.holder = account_holder
        # Additional methods would be defined here
```

This attribute can still be accessed from any instance of the class.

```
>>> spock_account = Account('Spock')
>>> kirk_account = Account('Kirk')
>>> spock_account.interest
0.02
>>> kirk_account.interest
0.02
```

However, **a single assignment statement to a class attribute changes the value of the attribute for all instances of the class.**

```
>>> Account.interest = 0.04
>>> spock_account.interest
0.04
>>> kirk_account.interest
0.04
```

**Attribute names.** We have introduced enough complexity into our object system that we have to specify how names are resolved to particular attributes. After all, we could easily have a class attribute and an instance attribute with the same name.

As we have seen, a dot expression consists of an expression, a dot, and a name:

```
<expression> . <name>
```

To evaluate a dot expression:

1. **Evaluate the `<expression>` to the left of the dot, which yields the *object* of the dot expression.**
2. **`<name>` is matched against the instance attributes of that object; if an attribute with that name exists, its value is returned.**
3. **If `<name>` does not appear among instance attributes, then `<name>` is looked up in the class, which yields a class attribute value.**
4. **That value is returned unless it is a function, in which case a bound method is returned instead.**

In this evaluation procedure, **instance attributes are found before class attributes**, just as local names have priority over global in an environment. **Methods defined within the class are combined with the object of the dot expression to form a bound method during the fourth step of this evaluation procedure.** The procedure for looking up a name in a class has additional nuances that will arise shortly, once we introduce class inheritance.

**Attribute assignment.** All assignment statements that contain a dot expression on their left-hand side affect attributes for the object of that dot expression. <u>If the object is an instance, then assignment sets an instance attribute. If the object is a class, then assignment sets a class attribute. As a consequence of this rule, assignment to an attribute of an object cannot affect the attributes of its class.</u> The examples below illustrate this distinction.

If we assign to the named attribute `interest` of an account instance, we create a new instance attribute that has the same name as the existing class attribute.

```
>>> kirk_account.interest = 0.08
```

and that attribute value will be returned from a dot expression.

```
>>> kirk_account.interest
0.08
```

However, the class attribute `interest` still retains its original value, which is returned for all other accounts.

```
>>> spock_account.interest
0.04
```

Changes to the class attribute `interest` will affect `spock_account`, but the instance attribute for `kirk_account` will be unaffected.

```
>>> Account.interest = 0.05  # changing the class attribute
>>> spock_account.interest     # changes instances without like-named instance attributes
0.05
>>> kirk_account.interest     # but the existing instance attribute is unaffected
0.08
```

### Objects

```python
class Clown:
    """An illustration of a class statement. This class is not useful.

    >>> Clown.nose
    'big and red'
    >>> Clown.dance()
    'No thanks'
    """
    nose = 'big and red'
    def dance():
        return 'No thanks'


class Account:
    """An account has a balance and a holder.
    All accounts share a common interest rate.

    >>> a = Account('John')
    >>> a.holder
    'John'
    >>> a.deposit(100)
    100
    >>> a.withdraw(90)
    10

    >>> a.balance
    10
    >>> a.interest
    0.02
    >>> Account.interest = 0.04
    >>> a.interest
    0.04
    """

    interest = 0.02  # A class attribute

    def __init__(self, account_holder):
        self.holder = account_holder
        self.balance = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """Add amount to balance."""
        self.balance = self.balance + amount
        return self.balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """Subtract amount from balance if funds are available."""
        if amount > self.balance:
            return 'Insufficient funds'
        self.balance = self.balance - amount
        return self.balance
```

### 2.5.6 Using Inheritance

First, we give a full implementation of the `Account` class, which includes docstrings for the class and its methods.

```
>>> class Account:
        """A bank account that has a non-negative balance."""
        interest = 0.02
        def __init__(self, account_holder):
            self.balance = 0
            self.holder = account_holder
        def deposit(self, amount):
            """Increase the account balance by amount and return the new balance."""
            self.balance = self.balance + amount
            return self.balance
        def withdraw(self, amount):
            """Decrease the account balance by amount and return the new balance."""
            if amount > self.balance:
                return 'Insufficient funds'
            self.balance = self.balance - amount
            return self.balance
```

A full implementation of `CheckingAccount` appears below. We specify inheritance by placing an expression that evaluates to the **base class** in parentheses after the class name.

```
>>> class CheckingAccount(Account):
        """A bank account that charges for withdrawals."""
        withdraw_charge = 1
        interest = 0.01
        def withdraw(self, amount):
            return Account.withdraw(self, amount + self.withdraw_charge)
```

Here, we introduce a class attribute `withdraw_charge` that is specific to the `CheckingAccount` class. We assign a lower value to the `interest` attribute. We also define a new `withdraw` method to override the behavior defined in the `Account` class. With no further statements in the class suite, all other behavior is inherited from the base class `Account`.

```
>>> checking = CheckingAccount('Sam')
>>> checking.deposit(10)
10
>>> checking.withdraw(5)
4
>>> checking.interest
0.01
```

The expression `checking.deposit` evaluates to a bound method for making deposits, which was defined in the `Account` class. When Python resolves a name in a dot expression that is not an attribute of the instance, it looks up the name in the class. In fact, the act of "looking up" a name in a class tries to find that name in every base class in the inheritance chain for the original object's class. We can define this procedure recursively. **To look up a name in a class.**

1. **If it names an attribute in the class, return the attribute value.**
2. **Otherwise, look up the name in the base class, if there is one.**

In the case of `deposit`, Python would have looked for the name first on the instance, and then in the `CheckingAccount` class. Finally, it would look in the `Account` class, where `deposit` is defined. According to our evaluation rule for dot expressions, since `deposit` is a function looked up in the class for the `checking` instance, the dot expression evaluates to a bound method value. That method is invoked with the argument 10, which calls the deposit method with `self` bound to the `checking` object and `amount` bound to 10.

The class of an object stays constant throughout. Even though the `deposit` method was found in the `Account` class, `deposit` is called with `self` bound to an instance of `CheckingAccount`, not of `Account`.

**Calling ancestors.** Attributes that have been overridden are still accessible via class objects. For instance, we implemented the `withdraw` method of `CheckingAccount` by calling the `withdraw` method of `Account` with an argument that included the `withdraw_charge`.

Notice that we called `self.withdraw_charge` rather than the equivalent `CheckingAccount.withdraw_charge`. **The benefit of the former over the latter is that a class that inherits from `CheckingAccount` might override the withdrawal charge. If that is the case, we would like our implementation of `withdraw` to find that new value instead of the old one.**

**Interfaces.** It is extremely common in object-oriented programs that different types of objects will share the same attribute names. An ***object interface*** is a collection of attributes and conditions on those attributes. For example, all accounts must have `deposit` and `withdraw` methods that take numerical arguments, as well as a `balance` attribute. The classes `Account` and `CheckingAccount` both implement this interface. Inheritance specifically promotes name sharing in this way. In some programming languages such as Java, interface implementations must be explicitly declared. In others such as Python, Ruby, and Go, any object with the appropriate names implements an interface.

The parts of your program that use objects (rather than implementing them) are most robust to future changes if they do not make assumptions about object types, but instead only about their attribute names. That is, they use the object abstraction, rather than assuming anything about its implementation.

For example, let us say that we run a lottery, and we wish to deposit $5 into each of a list of accounts. The following implementation does not assume anything about the types of those accounts, and therefore works equally well with any type of object that has a `deposit` method:

```
>>> def deposit_all(winners, amount=5):
        for account in winners:
            account.deposit(amount)
```

The function `deposit_all` above assumes only that each `account` satisfies the account object abstraction, and so it will work with any other account classes that also implement this interface. Assuming a particular class of account would violate the abstraction barrier of the account object abstraction. For example, the following implementation will not necessarily work with new kinds of accounts:

```
>>> def deposit_all(winners, amount=5):
        for account in winners:
            Account.deposit(account, amount)
```

We will address this topic in more detail later in the chapter.

### 2.5.7 Multiple Inheritance

Python supports the concept of a subclass inheriting attributes from multiple base classes, a language feature called *multiple inheritance*.

Suppose that we have a `SavingsAccount` that inherits from `Account`, but charges customers a small fee every time they make a deposit.

```
>>> class SavingsAccount(Account):
        deposit_charge = 2
        def deposit(self, amount):
            return Account.deposit(self, amount - self.deposit_charge)
```

Then, a clever executive conceives of an `AsSeenOnTVAccount` account with the best features of both `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount`: withdrawal fees, deposit fees, and a low interest rate. It's both a checking and a savings account in one! "If we build it," the executive reasons, "someone will sign up and pay all those fees. We'll even give them a dollar."

```
>>> class AsSeenOnTVAccount(CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount):
        def __init__(self, account_holder):
            self.holder = account_holder
            self.balance = 1           # A free dollar!
```

In fact, this implementation is complete. Both withdrawal and deposits will generate fees, using the function definitions in `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` respectively.

```
>>> such_a_deal = AsSeenOnTVAccount("John")
>>> such_a_deal.balance
1
>>> such_a_deal.deposit(20)            # $2 fee from SavingsAccount.deposit
19
>>> such_a_deal.withdraw(5)            # $1 fee from CheckingAccount.withdraw
13
```

Non-ambiguous references are resolved correctly as expected:

```
>>> such_a_deal.deposit_charge
2
>>> such_a_deal.withdraw_charge
1
```

But what about when the reference is ambiguous, such as the reference to the `withdraw` method that is defined in both `Account` and `CheckingAccount`? The figure below depicts an ***inheritance graph*** for the `AsSeenOnTVAccount` class. Each arrow points from a subclass to a base class.

![image-20211203153525830](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211203153525830.png)

For a simple "diamond" shape like this, **Python resolves names from left to right, then upwards.** In this example, Python checks for an attribute name in the following classes, in order, until an attribute with that name is found:

```
AsSeenOnTVAccount, CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount, Account, object
```

There is no correct solution to the inheritance ordering problem, as there are cases in which we might prefer to give precedence to certain inherited classes over others. However, any programming language that supports multiple inheritance must select some ordering in a consistent way, so that users of the language can predict the behavior of their programs.

**Further reading.** Python resolves this name using a recursive algorithm called the C3 Method Resolution Ordering. The method resolution order of any class can be queried using the `mro` method on all classes.

```
>>> [c.__name__ for c in AsSeenOnTVAccount.mro()]
['AsSeenOnTVAccount', 'CheckingAccount', 'SavingsAccount', 'Account', 'object']
```

The precise algorithm for finding method resolution orderings is not a topic for this text, but is [described by Python's primary author](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html) with a reference to the original paper.

### 2.5.8 The Role of Objects

The Python object system is designed to **make data abstraction and message passing both convenient and flexible**. The specialized syntax of classes, methods, inheritance, and dot expressions all enable us to formalize the object metaphor in our programs, which improves our ability to organize large programs.

In particular, we would like our object system to promote a ***separation of concerns*** among the different aspects of the program. Each object in a program encapsulates and manages some part of the program's state, and each class statement defines the functions that implement some part of the program's overall logic. Abstraction barriers enforce the boundaries between different aspects of a large program.

<u>Object-oriented programming is particularly well-suited to programs that model systems that have separate but interacting parts.</u> For instance, different users interact in a social network, different characters interact in a game, and different shapes interact in a physical simulation. When representing such systems, the objects in a program often map naturally onto objects in the system being modeled, and classes represent their types and relationships.

On the other hand, classes may not provide the best mechanism for implementing certain abstractions. <u>Functional abstractions provide a more natural metaphor for representing relationships between inputs and outputs.</u> One should not feel compelled to fit every bit of logic in a program within a class, especially when defining independent functions for manipulating data is more natural. Functions can also enforce a separation of concerns.

Multi-paradigm languages such as Python allow programmers to match organizational paradigms to appropriate problems. <u>Learning to identify when to introduce a new class, as opposed to a new function, in order to simplify or modularize a program, is an important design skill in software engineering that deserves careful attention.</u>

## 2.7 Object Abstraction

The object system allows programmers to build and use abstract data representations efficiently. It is also designed to allow multiple representations of abstract data to coexist in the same program.

A central concept in object abstraction is a ***generic function***, which is a function that can accept values of multiple different types. We will consider three different techniques for implementing generic functions: **shared interfaces, type dispatching, and type coercion**. In the process of building up these concepts, we will also discover features of the Python object system that support the creation of generic functions.

### 2.7.1 String Conversion

<u>To represent data effectively, an object value should behave like the kind of data it is meant to represent, including producing a string representation of itself.</u> String representations of data values are especially important in an interactive language such as Python that automatically displays the string representation of the values of expressions in an interactive session.

String values provide a fundamental medium for communicating information among humans. Sequences of characters can be rendered on a screen, printed to paper, read aloud, converted to braille, or broadcast as Morse code. Strings are also fundamental to programming because they can represent Python expressions.

Python stipulates that all objects should produce two different string representations: one that is human-interpretable text and one that is a Python-interpretable expression. The constructor function for strings, `str`, returns a human-readable string. Where possible, the `repr` function returns a Python expression that evaluates to an equal object. The docstring for ***repr*** explains this property:

```
repr(object) -> string

Return the canonical string representation of the object.
For most object types, eval(repr(object)) == object.
```

The result of calling `repr` on the value of an expression is what Python prints in an interactive session.

```
>>> 12e12
12000000000000.0
>>> print(repr(12e12))
12000000000000.0
```

In cases where no representation exists that evaluates to the original value, Python typically produces a description surrounded by angled brackets.

```
>>> repr(min)
'<built-in function min>'
```

The `str` constructor often coincides with `repr`, but provides a more interpretable text representation in some cases. For instance, we see a difference between `str` and `repr` with dates.

```
>>> from datetime import date
>>> tues = date(2011, 9, 12)
>>> repr(tues)
'datetime.date(2011, 9, 12)'
>>> str(tues)
'2011-09-12'
```

Defining the `repr` function presents a new challenge: we would like it to apply correctly to all data types, even those that did not exist when `repr` was implemented. We would like it to be a generic or ***polymorphic function***, one that can be applied to many (*poly*) different forms (*morph*) of data.

The object system provides an elegant solution in this case: the `repr` function always invokes a method called `__repr__` on its argument.

```
>>> tues.__repr__()
'datetime.date(2011, 9, 12)'
```

By implementing this same method in user-defined classes, we can extend the applicability of `repr` to any class we create in the future. This example highlights another benefit of dot expressions in general, that <u>they provide a mechanism for extending the domain of existing functions to new object types.</u>

The `str` constructor is implemented in a similar manner: it invokes a method called `__str__` on its argument.

```
>>> tues.__str__()
'2011-09-12'
```

These polymorphic functions are examples of a more general principle: certain functions should apply to multiple data types. Moreover, one way to create such a function is to use a shared attribute name with a different definition in each class.

### 2.7.2 Special Methods

In Python, certain *special names* are invoked by the Python interpreter in special circumstances. For instance, the `__init__` method of a class is automatically invoked whenever an object is constructed. The `__str__` method is invoked automatically when printing, and `__repr__` is invoked in an interactive session to display values.

There are special names for many other behaviors in Python. Some of those used most commonly are described below.

**True and false values.** We saw previously that numbers in Python have a truth value; more specifically, 0 is a false value and all other numbers are true values. In fact, all objects in Python have a truth value. **By default, objects of user-defined classes are considered to be true, but the special `__bool__` method can be used to override this behavior. If an object defines the `__bool__` method, then Python calls that method to determine its truth value.**

As an example, suppose we want a bank account with 0 balance to be false. We can add a `__bool__` method to the `Account` class to create this behavior.

```
>>> Account.__bool__ = lambda self: self.balance != 0
```

We can call the `bool` constructor to see the truth value of an object, and we can use any object in a boolean context.

```
>>> bool(Account('Jack'))
False
>>> if not Account('Jack'):
        print('Jack has nothing')
Jack has nothing
```

**Sequence operations.** We have seen that we can call the `len` function to determine the length of a sequence.

```
>>> len('Go Bears!')
9
```

The `len` function invokes the `__len__` method of its argument to determine its length. All built-in sequence types implement this method.

```
>>> 'Go Bears!'.__len__()
9
```

Python uses a sequence's length to determine its truth value, if it does not provide a `__bool__` method. **Empty sequences are false, while non-empty sequences are true.**

```
>>> bool('')
False
>>> bool([])
False
>>> bool('Go Bears!')
True
```

The `__getitem__` method is invoked by the element selection operator, but it can also be invoked directly.

```
>>> 'Go Bears!'[3]
'B'
>>> 'Go Bears!'.__getitem__(3)
'B'
```

**Callable objects.** In Python, functions are first-class objects, so they can be passed around as data and have attributes like any other object. Python also allows us to define objects that can be "called" like functions by including a `__call__` method. **With this method, we can define a class that behaves like a higher-order function.**

As an example, consider the following higher-order function, which returns a function that adds a constant value to its argument.

```
>>> def make_adder(n):
        def adder(k):
            return n + k
        return adder
>>> add_three = make_adder(3)
>>> add_three(4)
7
```

We can create an `Adder` class that defines a `__call__` method to provide the same functionality.

```
>>> class Adder(object):
        def __init__(self, n):
            self.n = n
        def __call__(self, k):
            return self.n + k
>>> add_three_obj = Adder(3)
>>> add_three_obj(4)
7
```

Here, the `Adder` class behaves like the `make_adder` higher-order function, and the `add_three_obj` object behaves like the `add_three` function. We have further blurred the line between data and functions.

**Arithmetic.** Special methods can also define the behavior of built-in operators applied to user-defined objects. In order to provide this generality, Python follows specific protocols to apply each operator. For example, to evaluate expressions that contain the `+` operator, Python checks for special methods on both the left and right operands of the expression. First, Python checks for an `__add__` method on the value of the left operand, then checks for an `__radd__` method on the value of the right operand. If either is found, that method is invoked with the value of the other operand as its argument. Some examples are given in the following sections. For readers interested in further details, the Python documentation describes the exhaustive set of [method names for operators](http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names). Dive into Python 3 has a chapter on [special method names](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/special-method-names.html) that describes how many of these special method names are used.

### 2.7.3 Multiple Representations

Abstraction barriers allow us to separate the use and representation of data. However, in large programs, it may not always make sense to speak of "the underlying representation" for a data type in a program. For one thing, there might be more than one useful representation for a data object, and we might like to design systems that can deal with multiple representations.

To take a simple example, complex numbers may be represented in two almost equivalent ways: in rectangular form (real and imaginary parts) and in polar form (magnitude and angle). Sometimes the rectangular form is more appropriate and sometimes the polar form is more appropriate. Indeed, it is perfectly plausible to imagine a system in which complex numbers are represented in both ways, and in which the functions for manipulating complex numbers work with either representation. We implement such a system below. As a side note, we are developing a system that performs arithmetic operations on complex numbers as a simple but unrealistic example of a program that uses generic operations. A [complex number type](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric) is actually built into Python, but for this example we will implement our own.

The idea of allowing for multiple representations of data arises regularly. <u>Large software systems are often designed by many people working over extended periods of time, subject to requirements that change over time.</u> In such an environment, it is simply not possible for everyone to agree in advance on choices of data representation. **In addition to the data-abstraction barriers that isolate representation from use, we need abstraction barriers that isolate different design choices from each other and permit different choices to coexist in a single program.**

We will begin our implementation at the highest level of abstraction and work towards concrete representations. A `Complex` number is a `Number`, and numbers can be added or multiplied together. How numbers can be added or multiplied is abstracted by the method names `add` and `mul`.

```
>>> class Number:
        def __add__(self, other):
            return self.add(other)
        def __mul__(self, other):
            return self.mul(other)
```

This class requires that Number objects have `add` and `mul` methods, but does not define them. Moreover, it does not have an `__init__` method. The purpose of `Number` is not to be instantiated directly, but instead to serve as a superclass of various specific number classes. Our next task is to define `add` and `mul` appropriately for complex numbers.

A complex number can be thought of as a point in two-dimensional space with two orthogonal axes, the real axis and the imaginary axis. From this perspective, the complex number `c = real + imag * i` (where `i * i = -1`) can be thought of as the point in the plane whose horizontal coordinate is `real` and whose vertical coordinate is `imag`. Adding complex numbers involves adding their respective `real` and `imag` coordinates.

When multiplying complex numbers, it is more natural to think in terms of representing a complex number in polar form, as a `magnitude` and an `angle`. The product of two complex numbers is the vector obtained by stretching one complex number by a factor of the length of the other, and then rotating it through the angle of the other.

The `Complex` class inherits from `Number` and describes arithmetic for complex numbers.

```
>>> class Complex(Number):
        def add(self, other):
            return ComplexRI(self.real + other.real, self.imag + other.imag)
        def mul(self, other):
            magnitude = self.magnitude * other.magnitude
            return ComplexMA(magnitude, self.angle + other.angle)
```

This implementation assumes that two classes exist for complex numbers, corresponding to their two natural representations:

- `ComplexRI` constructs a complex number from real and imaginary parts.
- `ComplexMA` constructs a complex number from a magnitude and angle.

**Interfaces.** Object attributes, which are a form of message passing, allows different data types to respond to the same message in different ways. A shared set of messages that elicit similar behavior from different classes is a powerful method of abstraction. An ***interface*** is **a set of shared attribute names, along with a specification of their behavior**. In the case of complex numbers, the interface needed to implement arithmetic consists of four attributes: `real`, `imag`, `magnitude`, and `angle`.

For complex arithmetic to be correct, these attributes must be consistent. That is, the rectangular coordinates `(real, imag)` and the polar coordinates `(magnitude, angle)` must describe the same point on the complex plane. The `Complex` class implicitly defines this interface by determining how these attributes are used to `add` and `mul` complex numbers.

**Properties.** The requirement that two or more attribute values maintain a fixed relationship with each other is a new problem. One solution is to store attribute values for only one representation and compute the other representation whenever it is needed.

**Python has a simple feature for computing attributes on the fly from zero-argument functions. The `@property` decorator allows functions to be called without call expression syntax (parentheses following an expression).** The `ComplexRI` class stores `real` and `imag` attributes and computes `magnitude` and `angle` on demand.

```
>>> from math import atan2
>>> class ComplexRI(Complex):
        def __init__(self, real, imag):
            self.real = real
            self.imag = imag
        @property
        def magnitude(self):
            return (self.real ** 2 + self.imag ** 2) ** 0.5
        @property
        def angle(self):
            return atan2(self.imag, self.real)
        def __repr__(self):
            return 'ComplexRI({0:g}, {1:g})'.format(self.real, self.imag)
```

As a result of this implementation, all four attributes needed for complex arithmetic can be accessed without any call expressions, and changes to `real` or `imag` are reflected in the `magnitude` and `angle`.

```
>>> ri = ComplexRI(5, 12)
>>> ri.real
5
>>> ri.magnitude
13.0
>>> ri.real = 9
>>> ri.real
9
>>> ri.magnitude
15.0
```

Similarly, the `ComplexMA` class stores `magnitude` and `angle`, but computes `real` and `imag` whenever those attributes are looked up.

```
>>> from math import sin, cos, pi
>>> class ComplexMA(Complex):
        def __init__(self, magnitude, angle):
            self.magnitude = magnitude
            self.angle = angle
        @property
        def real(self):
            return self.magnitude * cos(self.angle)
        @property
        def imag(self):
            return self.magnitude * sin(self.angle)
        def __repr__(self):
            return 'ComplexMA({0:g}, {1:g} * pi)'.format(self.magnitude, self.angle/pi)
```

Changes to the magnitude or angle are reflected immediately in the `real` and `imag` attributes.

```
>>> ma = ComplexMA(2, pi/2)
>>> ma.imag
2.0
>>> ma.angle = pi
>>> ma.real
-2.0
```

Our implementation of complex numbers is now complete. Either class implementing complex numbers can be used for either argument in either arithmetic function in `Complex`.

```
>>> from math import pi
>>> ComplexRI(1, 2) + ComplexMA(2, pi/2)
ComplexRI(1, 4)
>>> ComplexRI(0, 1) * ComplexRI(0, 1)
ComplexMA(1, 1 * pi)
```

The interface approach to encoding multiple representations has appealing properties. The class for each representation can be developed separately; they must only agree on the names of the attributes they share, as well as any behavior conditions for those attributes. The interface is also ***additive***. If another programmer wanted to add a third representation of complex numbers to the same program, they would only have to create another class with the same attributes.

Multiple representations of data are closely related to the idea of data abstraction with which we began this chapter. **Using data abstraction, we were able to change the implementation of a data type without changing the meaning of the program. With interfaces and message passing, we can have multiple different representations within the same program.** In both cases, **a set of names and corresponding behavior conditions define the abstraction that enables this flexibility.**

### 2.7.4 Generic Functions

Generic functions are methods or functions that apply to arguments of different types. We have seen many examples already. The `Complex.add` method is generic, because it can take either a `ComplexRI` or `ComplexMA` as the value for `other`. This flexibility was gained by ensuring that both `ComplexRI` and `ComplexMA` share an interface. **Using interfaces and message passing is only one of several methods used to implement generic functions.** We will consider two others in this section: **type dispatching and type coercion**.

Suppose that, in addition to our complex number classes, we implement a `Rational` class to represent fractions exactly. The `add` and `mul` methods express the same computations as the `add_rational` and `mul_rational` functions from earlier in the chapter.

```
>>> from fractions import gcd
>>> class Rational(Number):
        def __init__(self, numer, denom):
            g = gcd(numer, denom)
            self.numer = numer // g
            self.denom = denom // g
        def __repr__(self):
            return 'Rational({0}, {1})'.format(self.numer, self.denom)
        def add(self, other):
            nx, dx = self.numer, self.denom
            ny, dy = other.numer, other.denom
            return Rational(nx * dy + ny * dx, dx * dy)
        def mul(self, other):
            numer = self.numer * other.numer
            denom = self.denom * other.denom
            return Rational(numer, denom)
```

We have implemented the interface of the `Number` superclass by including `add` and `mul` methods. As a result, we can add and multiply rational numbers using familiar operators.

```
>>> Rational(2, 5) + Rational(1, 10)
Rational(1, 2)
>>> Rational(1, 4) * Rational(2, 3)
Rational(1, 6)
```

However, we cannot yet add a rational number to a complex number, although in mathematics such a combination is well-defined. We would like to introduce this cross-type operation in some carefully controlled way, so that we can support it without seriously violating our abstraction barriers. <u>There is a tension between the outcomes we desire: we would like to be able to add a complex number to a rational number, and we would like to do so using a generic `__add__` method that does the right thing with all numeric types. At the same time, we would like to separate the concerns of complex numbers and rational numbers whenever possible, in order to maintain a modular program.</u>

**Type dispatching.** One way to implement cross-type operations is to select behavior based on the types of the arguments to a function or method. The idea of type dispatching is to write functions that inspect the type of arguments they receive, then execute code that is appropriate for those types.

The built-in function `isinstance` takes an object and a class. **It returns true if the object has a class that either is or inherits from the given class.**

```
>>> c = ComplexRI(1, 1)
>>> isinstance(c, ComplexRI)
True
>>> isinstance(c, Complex)
True
>>> isinstance(c, ComplexMA)
False
```

A simple example of type dispatching is an `is_real` function that uses a different implementation for each type of complex number.

```
>>> def is_real(c):
        """Return whether c is a real number with no imaginary part."""
        if isinstance(c, ComplexRI):
            return c.imag == 0
        elif isinstance(c, ComplexMA):
            return c.angle % pi == 0
>>> is_real(ComplexRI(1, 1))
False
>>> is_real(ComplexMA(2, pi))
True
```

Type dispatching is not always performed using `isinstance`. For arithmetic, we will give a `type_tag` attribute to `Rational` and `Complex` instances that has a string value. When two values `x` and `y` have the same `type_tag`, then we can combine them directly with `x.add(y)`. If not, we need a cross-type operation.

```
>>> Rational.type_tag = 'rat'
>>> Complex.type_tag = 'com'
>>> Rational(2, 5).type_tag == Rational(1, 2).type_tag
True
>>> ComplexRI(1, 1).type_tag == ComplexMA(2, pi/2).type_tag
True
>>> Rational(2, 5).type_tag == ComplexRI(1, 1).type_tag
False
```

To combine complex and rational numbers, we write functions that rely on both of their representations simultaneously. Below, we rely on the fact that a `Rational` can be converted approximately to a `float` value that is a real number. The result can be combined with a complex number.

```
>>> def add_complex_and_rational(c, r):
        return ComplexRI(c.real + r.numer/r.denom, c.imag)
```

Multiplication involves a similar conversion. In polar form, a real number in the complex plane always has a positive magnitude. The angle 0 indicates a positive number. The angle `pi` indicates a negative number.

```
>>> def mul_complex_and_rational(c, r):
        r_magnitude, r_angle = r.numer/r.denom, 0
        if r_magnitude < 0:
            r_magnitude, r_angle = -r_magnitude, pi
        return ComplexMA(c.magnitude * r_magnitude, c.angle + r_angle)
```

Both addition and multiplication are commutative, so swapping the argument order can use the same implementations of these cross-type operations.

```
>>> def add_rational_and_complex(r, c):
        return add_complex_and_rational(c, r)
>>> def mul_rational_and_complex(r, c):
        return mul_complex_and_rational(c, r)
```

**The role of type dispatching is to ensure that these cross-type operations are used at appropriate times.** Below, we rewrite the `Number` superclass to use type dispatching for its `__add__` and `__mul__` methods.

We use the `type_tag` attribute to distinguish types of arguments. One could directly use the built-in `isinstance` method as well, but tags simplify the implementation. Using type tags also illustrates that type dispatching is not necessarily linked to the Python object system, but instead a general technique for creating generic functions over heterogeneous domains.

The `__add__` method considers two cases. First, if two arguments have the same type tag, then it assumes that `add` method of the first can take the second as an argument. Otherwise, it checks whether a dictionary of cross-type implementations, called `adders`, contains a function that can add arguments of those type tags. If there is such a function, the `cross_apply` method finds and applies it. The `__mul__` method has a similar structure.

```
>>> class Number:
        def __add__(self, other):
            if self.type_tag == other.type_tag:
                return self.add(other)
            elif (self.type_tag, other.type_tag) in self.adders:
                return self.cross_apply(other, self.adders)
        def __mul__(self, other):
            if self.type_tag == other.type_tag:
                return self.mul(other)
            elif (self.type_tag, other.type_tag) in self.multipliers:
                return self.cross_apply(other, self.multipliers)
        def cross_apply(self, other, cross_fns):
            cross_fn = cross_fns[(self.type_tag, other.type_tag)]
            return cross_fn(self, other)
        adders = {("com", "rat"): add_complex_and_rational,
                  ("rat", "com"): add_rational_and_complex}
        multipliers = {("com", "rat"): mul_complex_and_rational,
                       ("rat", "com"): mul_rational_and_complex}
```

In this new definition of the `Number` class, all cross-type implementations are indexed by pairs of type tags in the `adders` and `multipliers` dictionaries.

<u>This dictionary-based approach to type dispatching is extensible.</u> New subclasses of `Number` could install themselves into the system by declaring a type tag and adding cross-type operations to `Number.adders` and `Number.multipliers`. They could also define their own `adders` and `multipliers` in a subclass.

While we have introduced some complexity to the system, we can now mix types in addition and multiplication expressions.

```
>>> ComplexRI(1.5, 0) + Rational(3, 2)
ComplexRI(3, 0)
>>> Rational(-1, 2) * ComplexMA(4, pi/2)
ComplexMA(2, 1.5 * pi)
```

**Coercion.** In the general situation of completely unrelated operations acting on completely unrelated types, implementing explicit cross-type operations, cumbersome though it may be, is the best that one can hope for. Fortunately, we can sometimes do better by taking advantage of additional structure that may be latent in our type system. **Often the different data types are not completely independent, and there may be ways by which objects of one type may be viewed as being of another type.** This process is called ***coercion***. For example, if we are asked to arithmetically combine a rational number with a complex number, we can view the rational number as a complex number whose imaginary part is zero. After doing so, we can use `Complex.add` and `Complex.mul` to combine them.

In general, we can implement this idea by designing coercion functions that transform an object of one type into an equivalent object of another type. Here is a typical coercion function, which transforms a rational number to a complex number with zero imaginary part:

```
>>> def rational_to_complex(r):
        return ComplexRI(r.numer/r.denom, 0)
```

The alternative definition of the `Number` class performs cross-type operations by attempting to coerce both arguments to the same type. The `coercions` dictionary indexes all possible coercions by a pair of type tags, indicating that the corresponding value coerces a value of the first type to a value of the second type.

It is not generally possible to coerce an arbitrary data object of each type into all other types. For example, there is no way to coerce an arbitrary complex number to a rational number, so there will be no such conversion implementation in the `coercions` dictionary.

The `coerce` method returns two values with the same type tag. It inspects the type tags of its arguments, compares them to entries in the `coercions` dictionary, and converts one argument to the type of the other using `coerce_to`. Only one entry in `coercions` is necessary to complete our cross-type arithmetic system, replacing the four cross-type functions in the type-dispatching version of `Number`.

```
>>> class Number:
        def __add__(self, other):
            x, y = self.coerce(other)
            return x.add(y)
        def __mul__(self, other):
            x, y = self.coerce(other)
            return x.mul(y)
        def coerce(self, other):
            if self.type_tag == other.type_tag:
                return self, other
            elif (self.type_tag, other.type_tag) in self.coercions:
                return (self.coerce_to(other.type_tag), other)
            elif (other.type_tag, self.type_tag) in self.coercions:
                return (self, other.coerce_to(self.type_tag))
        def coerce_to(self, other_tag):
            coercion_fn = self.coercions[(self.type_tag, other_tag)]
            return coercion_fn(self)
        coercions = {('rat', 'com'): rational_to_complex}
```

This coercion scheme has some advantages over the method of defining explicit cross-type operations. Although we still need to write coercion functions to relate the types, we need to write only one function for each pair of types rather than a different function for each set of types and each generic operation. What we are counting on here is the fact that the appropriate transformation between types depends only on the types themselves, not on the particular operation to be applied.

Further advantages come from extending coercion. <u>Some more sophisticated coercion schemes do not just try to coerce one type into another, but instead may try to coerce two different types each into a third common type.</u> Consider a rhombus and a rectangle: neither is a special case of the other, but both can be viewed as quadrilaterals. <u>Another extension to coercion is iterative coercion, in which one data type is coerced into another via intermediate types.</u> Consider that an integer can be converted into a real number by first converting it into a rational number, then converting that rational number into a real number. Chaining coercion in this way can reduce the total number of coercion functions that are required by a program.

Despite its advantages, coercion does have potential drawbacks. For one, coercion functions can lose information when they are applied. In our example, rational numbers are exact representations, but become approximations when they are converted to complex numbers.

Some programming languages have automatic coercion systems built in. In fact, early versions of Python had a `__coerce__` special method on objects. In the end, the complexity of the built-in coercion system did not justify its use, and so it was removed. Instead, particular operators apply coercion to their arguments as needed.

## 2.9 Recursive Objects

Objects can have other objects as attribute values. **When an object of some class has an attribute value of that same class, it is a recursive object.**

### 2.9.1 Linked List Class

A linked list, introduced earlier in this chapter, is composed of a first element and the rest of the list. The rest of a linked list is itself a linked list — a recursive definition. The empty list is a special case of a linked list that has no first element or rest. A linked list is a sequence: it has a finite length and supports element selection by index.

We can now implement a class with the same behavior. In this version, we will define its behavior using special method names that allow our class to work with the built-in `len` function and element selection operator (square brackets or `operator.getitem`) in Python. These built-in functions invoke special method names of a class: length is computed by `__len__` and element selection is computed by `__getitem__`. The empty linked list is represented by an empty tuple, which has length 0 and no elements.

```
>>> class Link:
        """A linked list with a first element and the rest."""
        empty = ()
        def __init__(self, first, rest=empty):
            assert rest is Link.empty or isinstance(rest, Link)
            self.first = first
            self.rest = rest
        def __getitem__(self, i):
            if i == 0:
                return self.first
            else:
                return self.rest[i-1]
        def __len__(self):
            return 1 + len(self.rest)
>>> s = Link(3, Link(4, Link(5)))
>>> len(s)
3
>>> s[1]
4
```

The definitions of `__len__` and `__getitem__` are in fact recursive. The built-in Python function `len` invokes a method called `__len__` when applied to a user-defined object argument. Likewise, the element selection operator invokes a method called `__getitem__`. Thus, bodies of these two methods will call themselves indirectly. For `__len__`, the base case is reached when `self.rest` evaluates to the empty tuple, `Link.empty`, which has a length of 0.

The built-in `isinstance` function returns whether the first argument has a type that is or inherits from the second argument. `isinstance(rest, Link)` is true if `rest` is a `Link` instance or an instance of some sub-class of `Link`.

Our implementation is complete, but an instance of the `Link` class is currently difficult to inspect. To help with debugging, we can also define a function to convert a `Link` to a string expression.

```
>>> def link_expression(s):
        """Return a string that would evaluate to s."""
        if s.rest is Link.empty:
            rest = ''
        else:
            rest = ', ' + link_expression(s.rest)
        return 'Link({0}{1})'.format(s.first, rest)
>>> link_expression(s)
'Link(3, Link(4, Link(5)))'
```

This way of displaying an `Link` is so convenient that we would like to use it whenever an `Link` instance is displayed. We can ensure this behavior by setting the `link_expression` function as the value of the special class attribute `__repr__`. Python displays instances of user-defined classes by invoking their `__repr__` method.

```
>>> Link.__repr__ = link_expression
>>> s
Link(3, Link(4, Link(5)))
```

The `Link` class has the closure property. Just as an element of a list can itself be a list, a `Link` can contain a `Link` as its `first` element.

```
>>> s_first = Link(s, Link(6))
>>> s_first
Link(Link(3, Link(4, Link(5))), Link(6))
```

The `s_first` linked list has only two elements, but its first element is a linked list with three elements.

```
>>> len(s_first)
2
>>> len(s_first[0])
3
>>> s_first[0][2]
5
```

Recursive functions are particularly well-suited to manipulate linked lists. For instance, the recursive `extend_link` function builds a linked list containing the elements of one `Link` instance `s` followed by the elements of another `Link` instance `t`. Installing this function as the `__add__` method of the `Link` class emulates the addition behavior of a built-in list.

```
>>> def extend_link(s, t):
        if s is Link.empty:
            return t
        else:
            return Link(s.first, extend_link(s.rest, t))
>>> extend_link(s, s)
Link(3, Link(4, Link(5, Link(3, Link(4, Link(5))))))
>>> Link.__add__ = extend_link
>>> s + s
Link(3, Link(4, Link(5, Link(3, Link(4, Link(5))))))
```

Rather than list comprehensions, one linked list can be generated from another using two higher-order functions: `map_link` and `filter_link`. The `map_link` function defined below applies a function `f` to each element of a linked list `s` and constructs a linked list containing the results.

```
>>> def map_link(f, s):
        if s is Link.empty:
            return s
        else:
            return Link(f(s.first), map_link(f, s.rest))
>>> map_link(square, s)
Link(9, Link(16, Link(25)))
```

The `filter_link` function returns a linked list containing all elements of a linked list `s` for which `f` returns a true value. The combination of `map_link` and `filter_link` can express the same logic as a list comprehension.

```
>>> def filter_link(f, s):
        if s is Link.empty:
            return s
        else:
            filtered = filter_link(f, s.rest)
            if f(s.first):
                return Link(s.first, filtered)
            else:
                return filtered
>>> odd = lambda x: x % 2 == 1
>>> map_link(square, filter_link(odd, s))
Link(9, Link(25))
>>> [square(x) for x in [3, 4, 5] if odd(x)]
[9, 25]
```

The `join_link` function recursively constructs a string that contains the elements of a linked list seperated by some `separator` string. The result is much more compact than the output of `link_expression`.

```
>>> def join_link(s, separator):
        if s is Link.empty:
            return ""
        elif s.rest is Link.empty:
            return str(s.first)
        else:
            return str(s.first) + separator + join_link(s.rest, separator)
>>> join_link(s, ", ")
'3, 4, 5'
```

**Recursive Construction.** Linked lists are particularly useful when constructing sequences incrementally, a situation that arises often in recursive computations.

The `count_partitions` function from Chapter 1 counted the number of ways to partition an integer `n` using parts up to size `m` via a tree-recursive process. With sequences, we can also enumerate these partitions explicitly using a similar process.

We follow the same recursive analysis of the problem as we did while counting: partitioning `n` using integers up to `m` involves either

1. partitioning `n-m` using integers up to `m`, or
2. partitioning `n` using integers up to `m-1`.

For base cases, we find that 0 has an empty partition, while partitioning a negative integer or using parts smaller than 1 is impossible.

```
>>> def partitions(n, m):
        """Return a linked list of partitions of n using parts of up to m.
        Each partition is represented as a linked list.
        """
        if n == 0:
            return Link(Link.empty) # A list containing the empty partition
        elif n < 0 or m == 0:
            return Link.empty
        else:
            using_m = partitions(n-m, m)
            with_m = map_link(lambda s: Link(m, s), using_m)
            without_m = partitions(n, m-1)
            return with_m + without_m
```

In the recursive case, we construct two sublists of partitions. The first uses `m`, and so we add `m` to each element of the result `using_m` to form `with_m`.

The result of `partitions` is highly nested: a linked list of linked lists. Using `join_link` with appropriate separators, we can display the partitions in a human-readable manner.

```
>>> def print_partitions(n, m):
        lists = partitions(n, m)
        strings = map_link(lambda s: join_link(s, " + "), lists)
        print(join_link(strings, "\n"))
>>> print_partitions(6, 4)
4 + 2
4 + 1 + 1
3 + 3
3 + 2 + 1
3 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```

### 2.9.2 Tree Class

Trees can also be represented by instances of user-defined classes, rather than nested instances of built-in sequence types. A tree is any data structure that has as an attribute a sequence of branches that are also trees.

**Internal values.** Previously, we defined trees in such a way that all values appeared at the leaves of the tree. It is also common to define trees that have internal values at the roots of each subtree. An internal value is called an `label` in the tree. The `Tree` class below represents such trees, in which each tree has a sequence of branches that are also trees.

```
>>> class Tree:
        def __init__(self, label, branches=()):
            self.label = label
            for branch in branches:
                assert isinstance(branch, Tree)
            self.branches = branches
        def __repr__(self):
            if self.branches:
                return 'Tree({0}, {1})'.format(self.label, repr(self.branches))
            else:
                return 'Tree({0})'.format(repr(self.label))

```

The `Tree` class can represent, for instance, the values computed in an expression tree for the recursive implementation of `fib`, the function for computing Fibonacci numbers. The function `fib_tree(n)` below returns a `Tree` that has the nth Fibonacci number as its `label` and a trace of all previously computed Fibonacci numbers within its branches.

```
>>> def fib_tree(n):
        if n == 1:
            return Tree(0)
        elif n == 2:
            return Tree(1)
        else:
            left = fib_tree(n-2)
            right = fib_tree(n-1)
            return Tree(left.label + right.label, (left, right))
>>> fib_tree(5)
Tree(3, (Tree(1, (Tree(0), Tree(1))), Tree(2, (Tree(1), Tree(1, (Tree(0), Tree(1)))))))
```

Trees represented in this way are also processed using recursive functions. For example, we can sum the labels of a tree. As a base case, we return that an empty branch has no labels.

```
>>> def sum_labels(t):
        """Sum the labels of a Tree instance, which may be None."""
        return t.label + sum([sum_labels(b) for b in t.branches])
>>> sum_labels(fib_tree(5))
10
```

We can also apply `memo` to construct a Fibonacci tree, where repeated subtrees are only created once by the memoized version of `fib_tree`, but are used multiple times as branches of different larger trees.

```
>>> fib_tree = memo(fib_tree)
>>> big_fib_tree = fib_tree(35)
>>> big_fib_tree.label
5702887
>>> big_fib_tree.branches[0] is big_fib_tree.branches[1].branches[1]
True
>>> sum_labels = memo(sum_labels)
>>> sum_labels(big_fib_tree)
142587180
```

The amount of computation time and memory saved by memoization in these cases is substantial. Instead of creating 18,454,929 different instances of the `Tree` class, we now create only 35.

[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D01cSWI3w7s&t=105s) Does the space complexity of recursive functions make them undesirable?

when you have just some iterative process you want to like go through all the elements in something

then in python and most other programming languages the best way to do it is just with a while or for loop 
and not to write it recursively 

recursion isn't really for that it can be used for that but what it's really for **tree recursion and processing trees or other hierarchical data structures**. that's where it's quite helpful 

should we not use recursion for stuff where we could just use a while loop? basically that's a good piece of advice

# Chapter 3: Interpreting Computer Programs

## 3.3 Exceptions

Programmers must be always mindful of possible errors that may arise in their programs. Examples abound: a function may not receive arguments that it is designed to accept, a necessary resource may be missing, or a connection across a network may be lost. When designing a program, one must anticipate the exceptional circumstances that may arise and take appropriate measures to handle them.

There is no single correct approach to handling errors in a program.  Programs designed to provide some persistent service like a web server should be robust to errors, logging them for later consideration but continuing to service new requests as long as possible. On the other hand, the Python interpreter handles errors by terminating immediately and printing an error message, so that programmers can address issues as soon as they arise. In any case, programmers must make conscious choices about how their programs should react to exceptional conditions.

*Exceptions*, the topic of this section, provides a general mechanism for adding error-handling logic to programs. *Raising an exception* is a technique for interrupting the normal flow of execution in a program, signaling that some exceptional circumstance has arisen, and returning directly to an enclosing part of the program that was designated to react to that circumstance.  The Python interpreter raises an exception each time it detects an error in an expression or statement.  Users can also raise exceptions with `raise` and `assert` statements.

**Raising exceptions.** An exception is a object instance with a class that inherits, either directly or indirectly, from the `BaseException` class. The `assert` statement introduced in Chapter 1 raises an exception with the class `AssertionError`.  In general, any exception instance can be raised with the `raise` statement. The general form of raise statements are described in the [Python docs](http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise). The most common use of `raise` constructs an exception instance and raises it.

```
>>> raise Exception('An error occurred')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
Exception: an error occurred
```

When an exception is raised, no further statements in the current block of code are executed. Unless the exception is *handled* (described below), the interpreter will return directly to the interactive read-eval-print loop, or terminate entirely if Python was started with a file argument. In addition, the interpreter will print a *stack backtrace*, which is a structured block of text that describes the nested set of active function calls in the branch of execution in which the exception was raised. In the example above, the file name `<stdin>` indicates that the exception was raised by the user in an interactive session, rather than from code in a file.

**Handling exceptions.** An exception can be handled by an enclosing `try` statement. A `try` statement consists of multiple clauses; the first begins with `try` and the rest begin with `except`:

```
try:
    <try suite>
except <exception class> as <name>:
    <except suite>
...
```

The `<try suite>` is always executed immediately when the `try` statement is executed.  Suites of the `except` clauses are only executed when an exception is raised during the course of executing the `<try suite>`. Each `except` clause specifies the particular class of exception to handle. For instance, if the `<exception class>` is `AssertionError`, then any instance of a class inheriting from `AssertionError` that is raised during the course of executing the `<try suite>` will be handled by the following `<except suite>`. Within the `<except suite>`, the identifier `<name>` is bound to the exception object that was raised, but this binding does not persist beyond the `<except suite>`.

For example, we can handle a `ZeroDivisionError` exception using a `try` statement that binds the name `x` to 0 when the exception is raised.

```
>>> try:
        x = 1/0
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print('handling a', type(e))
        x = 0
handling a <class 'ZeroDivisionError'>
>>> x
0
```

A `try` statement will handle exceptions that occur within the body of a function that is applied (either directly or indirectly) within the `<try suite>`.  When an exception is raised, control jumps directly to the body of the `<except suite>` of the most recent `try` statement that handles that type of exception.

```
>>> def invert(x):
        result = 1/x  # Raises a ZeroDivisionError if x is 0
        print('Never printed if x is 0')
        return result
>>> def invert_safe(x):
        try:
            return invert(x)
        except ZeroDivisionError as e:
            return str(e)
>>> invert_safe(2)
Never printed if x is 0
0.5
>>> invert_safe(0)
'division by zero'
```

This example illustrates that the `print` expression in `invert` is never evaluated, and instead control is transferred to the suite of the `except` clause in `invert_safe`. Coercing the `ZeroDivisionError` `e` to a string gives the human-interpretable string returned by `invert_safe`: `'division by zero'`.

### 3.3.1  Exception Objects

Exception objects themselves can have attributes, such as the error message stated in an `assert` statement and information about where in the course of execution the exception was raised. User-defined exception classes can have additional attributes.

In Chapter 1, we implemented Newton's method to find the zeros of arbitrary functions. The following example defines an exception class that returns the best guess discovered in the course of iterative improvement whenever a `ValueError` occurs. A math domain error (a type of `ValueError`) is raised when `sqrt` is applied to a negative number. This exception is handled by raising an `IterImproveError` that stores the most recent guess from Newton's method as an attribute.

First, we define a new class that inherits from `Exception`.

```
>>> class IterImproveError(Exception):
        def __init__(self, last_guess):
            self.last_guess = last_guess
```

Next, we define a version of `improve`, our generic iterative improvement algorithm.  This version handles any `ValueError` by raising an `IterImproveError` that stores the most recent guess. As before, `improve` takes as arguments two functions, each of which takes a single numerical argument. The `update` function returns new guesses, while the `done` function returns a boolean indicating that improvement has converged to a correct value.

```
>>> def improve(update, done, guess=1, max_updates=1000):
        k = 0
        try:
            while not done(guess) and k < max_updates:
                guess = update(guess)
                k = k + 1
            return guess
        except ValueError:
            raise IterImproveError(guess)
```

Finally, we define `find_zero`, which returns the result of `improve` applied to a Newton update function returned by `newton_update`, which is defined in Chapter 1 and requires no changes for this example. This version of `find_zero` handles an `IterImproveError` by returning its last guess.

```
>>> def find_zero(f, guess=1):
        def done(x):
            return f(x) == 0
        try:
            return improve(newton_update(f), done, guess)
        except IterImproveError as e:
            return e.last_guess
```

Consider applying `find_zero` to find the zero of the function 2x2+x2x^2 + \sqrt{x}. This function has a zero at 0, but evaluating it on any negative number will raise a `ValueError`. Our Chapter 1 implementation of Newton's Method would raise that error and fail to return any guess of the zero. Our revised implementation returns the last guess found before the error.

```
>>> from math import sqrt
>>> find_zero(lambda x: 2*x*x + sqrt(x))
-0.030211203830201594
```

Although this approximation is still far from the correct answer of 0, some applications would prefer this coarse approximation to a `ValueError`.

Exceptions are another technique that help us as programs to separate the concerns of our program into modular parts.  In this example, Python's exception mechanism allowed us to separate the logic for iterative improvement, which appears unchanged in the suite of the `try` clause, from the logic for handling errors, which appears in `except` clauses. We will also find that exceptions are a useful feature when implementing interpreters in Python.

# Chapter 3: Interpreting Computer Programs

## 3.1 Introduction

Chapters 1 and 2 describe the close connection between two fundamental elements of programming: functions and data. We saw how functions can be manipulated as data using higher-order functions. We also saw how data can be endowed with behavior using message passing and an object system. We have also studied techniques for organizing large programs, such as functional abstraction, data abstraction, class inheritance, and generic functions. These core concepts constitute a strong foundation upon which to build modular, maintainable, and extensible programs.

This chapter focuses on the third fundamental element of programming: programs themselves. A Python program is just a collection of text. Only through the process of interpretation do we perform any meaningful computation based on that text. A programming language like Python is useful because we can define an ***interpreter***, a program that carries out Python's evaluation and execution procedures. It is no exaggeration to regard this as the most fundamental idea in programming, that an interpreter, which determines the meaning of expressions in a programming language, is just another program.

To appreciate this point is to change our images of ourselves as programmers. We come to see ourselves as designers of languages, rather than only users of languages designed by others.

### 3.1.1 Programming Languages

Programming languages vary widely in their syntactic structures, features, and domain of application. Among general purpose programming languages, the constructs of function definition and function application are pervasive. On the other hand, powerful languages exist that do not include an object system, higher-order functions, assignment,  or even control constructs such as `while` and `for` statements. As an example of a powerful language with a minimal set of features, we will introduce the [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) programming language. The subset of Scheme introduced in this text does not allow mutable values at all.

In this chapter, we study the design of interpreters and the computational processes that they create when executing programs. The prospect of designing an interpreter for a general programming language may seem daunting. After all, interpreters are programs that can carry out any possible computation, depending on their input. However, many interpreters have an elegant common structure: two mutually recursive functions. **The first evaluates expressions in environments; the second applies functions to arguments.**

These functions are recursive in that they are defined in terms of each other: applying a function requires evaluating the expressions in its body, while evaluating an expression may involve applying one or more functions.

## 3.2 Functional Programming

The software running on any modern computer is written in a variety of programming languages. There are physical languages, such as the machine languages for particular computers. These languages are concerned with the representation of data and control in terms of individual bits of storage and primitive machine instructions. The machine-language programmer is concerned with using the given hardware to erect systems and utilities for the efficient implementation of resource-limited computations. High-level languages, erected on a machine-language substrate, hide concerns about the representation of data as collections of bits and the representation of programs as sequences of primitive instructions. These languages have means of combination and abstraction, such as function definition, that are appropriate to the larger-scale organization of software systems.

In this section, we introduce a high-level programming language that encourages a functional style. Our object of study, a subset of the Scheme language, employs a very similar model of computation to Python's, but uses only expressions (no statements), specializes in symbolic computation, and employs only immutable values.

Scheme is a dialect of [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), the second-oldest programming language that is still widely used today (after [Fortran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)). The community of Lisp programmers has continued to thrive for decades, and new dialects of Lisp such as [Clojure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) have some of the fastest growing communities of developers of any modern programming language. To follow along with the examples in this text, you can [download a Scheme interpreter](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~scheme/).

### 3.2.1 Expressions

Scheme programs consist of expressions, which are either call expressions or special forms. A call expression consists of an operator expression followed by zero or more operand sub-expressions, as in Python. Both the operator and operand are contained within parentheses:

```
(quotient 10 2)
```

5

Scheme exclusively uses prefix notation. Operators are often symbols, such as `+` and `*`. Call expressions can be nested, and they may span more than one line:

```
(+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))
```

19

```
(+ (* 3
      (+ (* 2 4)
         (+ 3 5)))
   (+ (- 10 7)
      6))
```

57

As in Python, Scheme expressions may be primitives or combinations. Number literals are primitives, while call expressions are combined forms that include arbitrary sub-expressions. The evaluation procedure of call expressions matches that of Python: first the operator and operand expressions are evaluated, and then the function that is the value of the operator is applied to the arguments that are the values of the operands.

The `if` expression in Scheme is a *special form*, meaning that while it looks syntactically like a call expression, it has a different evaluation procedure.  The general form of an `if` expression is:

```
(if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative>)
```

To evaluate an `if` expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating the `<predicate>` part of the expression. If the `<predicate>` evaluates to a true value, the interpreter then evaluates the `<consequent>` and returns its value. Otherwise it evaluates the `<alternative>` and returns its value.

Numerical values can be compared using familiar comparison operators, but prefix notation is used in this case as well:

```
(>= 2 1)
```
true


The boolean values `#t` (or `true`) and `#f` (or `false`) in Scheme can be combined with boolean special forms, which have evaluation procedures similar to those in Python.

> - `(and <e1> ... <en>)` The interpreter evaluates the expressions `<e>` one at a time, in left-to-right order. If any `<e>` evaluates to `false`, the value of the `and` expression is `false`, and the rest of the `<e>`'s are not evaluated. If all `<e>`'s evaluate to true values, the value of the `and` expression is the value of the last one.
> - `(or <e1> ... <en>)` The interpreter evaluates the expressions `<e>` one at a time, in left-to-right order. If any `<e>` evaluates to a true value, that value is returned as the value of the `or` expression, and the rest of the `<e>`'s are not evaluated. If all `<e>`'s evaluate to `false`, the value of the `or` expression is `false`.
> - `(not <e>)` The value of a not expression is `true` when the expression `<e>` evaluates to `false`, and `false` otherwise.

### 3.2.2 Definitions

Values can be named using the `define` special form:

```
(define pi 3.14)
(* pi 2)
```

6.28


New functions (called ***procedures*** in Scheme) can be defined using a second version of the `define` special form. For example, to define squaring, we write:

```
(define (square x) (* x x))
```

The general form of a procedure definition is:

```
(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)
```

The `<name>` is a symbol to be associated with the procedure definition in the environment. The `<formal parameters>` are the names used within the body of the procedure to refer to the corresponding arguments of the procedure. The `<body>` is an expression that will yield the value of the procedure application when the formal parameters are replaced by the actual arguments to which the procedure is applied. The `<name>` and the `<formal parameters>` are grouped within parentheses, just as they would be in an actual call to the procedure being defined.

Having defined square, we can now use it in call expressions:

```
(square 21)
```

441


```
(square (+ 2 5))
```

49


```
(square (square 3))
```

81


User-defined functions can take multiple arguments and include special forms:

```
(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(average 1 3)
```

2


```
(define (abs x)
    (if (< x 0)
        (- x)
        x))


(abs -3)
```

3


Scheme supports local definitions with the same lexical scoping rules as Python. Below, we define an iterative procedure for computing square roots using nested definitions and recursion:

```scheme
(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess)
    (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (define (improve guess)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (define (sqrt-iter guess)
    (if (good-enough? guess)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0))
(sqrt 9)
```

3.00009155413138


Anonymous functions are created using the `lambda` special form. `Lambda` is used to create procedures in the same way as `define`, except that no name is specified for the procedure:

```
(lambda (<formal-parameters>) <body>)
```

The resulting procedure is just as much a procedure as one that is created using `define`. The only difference is that it has not been associated with any name in the environment. In fact, the following expressions are equivalent:

```
(define (plus4 x) (+ x 4))
(define plus4 (lambda (x) (+ x 4)))
```

Like any expression that has a procedure as its value, a lambda expression can be used as the operator in a call expression:

```
((lambda (x y z) (+ x y (square z))) 1 2 3)
```

12

### 3.2.3 Compound values

Pairs are built into the Scheme language. For historical reasons, pairs are created with the `cons` built-in function, and the elements of a pair are accessed with `car` and `cdr`:

```
(define x (cons 1 2))


x
```

(1 . 2)


```
(car x)
```

1


```
(cdr x)
```

2


Recursive lists are also built into the language, using pairs. A special value denoted `nil` or `'()` represents the empty list. A recursive list value is rendered by placing its elements within parentheses, separated by spaces:

```
(cons 1
      (cons 2
            (cons 3
                  (cons 4 nil))))
```

(1 2 3 4)


```
(list 1 2 3 4)
```

(1 2 3 4)


```
(define one-through-four (list 1 2 3 4))


(car one-through-four)
```

1


```
(cdr one-through-four)
```

(2 3 4)


```
(car (cdr one-through-four))
```

2


```
(cons 10 one-through-four)
```

(10 1 2 3 4)


```
(cons 5 one-through-four)
```

(5 1 2 3 4)


Whether a list is empty can be determined using the primitive `null?` predicate. Using it, we can define the standard sequence operations for computing `length` and selecting elements:

```
(define (length items)
  (if (null? items)
      0
      (+ 1 (length (cdr items)))))
(define (getitem items n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (car items)
      (getitem (cdr items) (- n 1))))
(define squares (list 1 4 9 16 25))


(length squares)
```

5


```
(getitem squares 3)
```

16

>  think about domain and range
>
>  cons takes an element and a list gives you a slightly longer list
>
>  list takes a bunch of elements gives you a list 
>
>  append takes a bunch of lists and gives you a list 


### 3.2.4 Symbolic Data

All the compound data objects we have used so far were constructed ultimately from numbers. One of Scheme's strengths is working with arbitrary symbols as data.

In order to manipulate symbols we need a new element in our language: the ability to ***quote*** a data object. Suppose we want to construct the list `(a b)`. We can't accomplish this with `(list a b)`, because this expression constructs a list of the values of `a` and `b` rather than the symbols themselves. In Scheme, we refer to the symbols `a` and `b` rather than their values by preceding them with a single quotation mark:

```
(define a 1)
(define b 2)


(list a b)
```

(1 2)


```
(list 'a 'b)
```

(a b)


```
(list 'a b)
```

(a 2)


In Scheme, any expression that is not evaluated is said to be ***quoted***. This notion of quotation is derived from a classic philosophical distinction between a thing, such as a dog, which runs around and barks, and the word "dog" that is a linguistic construct for designating such things. When we use "dog" in quotation marks, we do not refer to some dog in particular but instead to a word. In language, quotation allow us to talk about language itself, and so it is in Scheme:

```
(list 'define 'list)
```

(define list)


Quotation also allows us to type in compound objects, using the conventional printed representation for lists:

```
(car '(a b c))
```

a


```
(cdr '(a b c))
```

(b c)


The full Scheme language contains additional features, such as mutation operations, vectors, and maps. However, the subset we have introduced so far provides a rich functional programming language capable of implementing many of the ideas we have discussed so far in this text.

### 3.2.5 Turtle graphics

The implementation of Scheme that serves as a companion to this text includes Turtle graphics, an illustrating environment developed as part of the Logo language (another Lisp dialect). This turtle begins in the center of a canvas, moves and turns based on procedures, and draws lines behind it as it moves. While the turtle was invented to engage children in the act of programming, it remains an engaging graphical tool for even advanced programmers.

At any moment during the course of executing a Scheme program, the turtle has a position and heading on the canvas. Single-argument procedures such as `forward` and `right` change the position and heading of the turtle. Common procedures have abbreviations: `forward` can also be called as `fd`, etc. The `begin` special form in Scheme allows a single expression to include multiple sub-expressions. This form is useful for issuing multiple commands:

```scheme
> (define (repeat k fn) (if (> k 0)
                            (begin (fn) (repeat (- k 1) fn))
                            nil))
> (repeat 5
          (lambda () (fd 100)
                     (repeat 5
                             (lambda () (fd 20) (rt 144)))
                     (rt 144)))
nil
```

![image-20211214141224176](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211214141224176.png)

The full repertoire of Turtle procedures is also built into Python as the [turtle library module](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/turtle.html).

As a final example, Scheme can express recursive drawings using its turtle graphics in a remarkably compact form. Sierpinski's triangle is a fractal that draws each triangle as three neighboring triangles that have vertexes at the midpoints of the legs of the triangle that contains them. It can be drawn to a finite recursive depth by this Scheme program:

```scheme
> (define (repeat k fn)
    (if (> k 0)
        (begin (fn) (repeat (- k 1) fn))
        nil))

> (define (tri fn)
    (repeat 3 (lambda () (fn) (lt 120))))

> (define (sier d k)
    (tri (lambda ()
           (if (= k 1) (fd d) (leg d k)))))

> (define (leg d k)
    (sier (/ d 2) (- k 1))
    (penup)
    (fd d)
    (pendown))
```

**The `triangle` procedure is a general method for repeating a drawing procedure three times with a left turn following each repetition. The `sier` procedure takes a length `d` and a recursive depth `k`. It draws a plain triangle if the depth is 1, and otherwise draws a triangle made up of calls to `leg`. The `leg` procedure draws a single leg of a recursive Sierpinski triangle by a recursive call to `sier` that fills the first half of the length of the leg, then by moving the turtle to the next vertex. The procedures `penup` and `pendown` stop the turtle from drawing as it moves by lifting its pen up and the placing it down again. The mutual recursion between `sier` and `leg` yields this result**:

## 3.4  Interpreters for Languages with Combination

We now embark on a tour of the technology by which languages are established in terms of other languages.  *Metalinguistic abstraction* — establishing new languages — plays an important role in all branches of engineering design. It is particularly important to computer programming, because in programming not only can we formulate new languages but we can also implement these languages by constructing interpreters. An interpreter for a programming language is a function that, when applied to an expression of the language, performs the actions required to evaluate that expression.

We will first define an interpreter for a language that is a limited subset of Scheme, called Calculator.  Then, we will develop a sketch of an interpreter for Scheme as a whole.  The interpreter we create will be complete in the sense that it will allow us to write fully general programs in Scheme. To do so, it will implement the same environment model of evaluation that we introduced for Python programs in Chapter 1.

Many of the examples in this section are contained in the companion [Scheme-Syntax Calculator example](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scalc.html), as they are too complex to fit naturally in the format of this text.

### 3.4.1  A Scheme-Syntax Calculator

The Scheme-Syntax Calculator (or simply Calculator) is an expression language for the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Calculator shares Scheme's call expression syntax and operator behavior. Addition (`+`) and multiplication (`*`) operations each take an arbitrary number of arguments:

```
> (+ 1 2 3 4)
10
> (+)
0
> (* 1 2 3 4)
24
> (*)
1
```

Subtraction (`-`) has two behaviors.  With one argument, it negates the argument.  With at least two arguments, it subtracts all but the first from the first.  Division (`/`) has a similar pair of two behaviors: compute the multiplicative inverse of a single argument or divide all but the first into the first:

```
> (- 10 1 2 3)
4
> (- 3)
-3
> (/ 15 12)
1.25
> (/ 30 5 2)
3
> (/ 10)
0.1
```

A call expression is evaluated by evaluating its operand sub-expressions, then applying the operator to the resulting arguments:

```
> (- 100 (* 7 (+ 8 (/ -12 -3))))
16.0
```

We will implement an interpreter for the Calculator language in Python.  That is, we will write a Python program that takes string lines as input and returns the result of evaluating those lines as a Calculator expression.  Our interpreter will raise an appropriate exception if the calculator expression is not well formed.

### 3.4.2  Expression Trees

Until this point in the course, expression trees have been conceptual entities to which we have referred in describing the process of evaluation; we have never before explicitly represented expression trees as data in our programs. In order to write an interpreter, we must operate on expressions as data.

A primitive expression is just a number or a string in Calculator: either an `int` or `float` or an operator symbol. All combined expressions are call expressions.  A call expression is a Scheme list with a first element (the operator) followed by zero or more operand expressions.

**Scheme Pairs.** In Scheme, lists are nested pairs, but not all pairs are lists.  To represent Scheme pairs and lists in Python, we will define a class `Pair` that is similar to the `Rlist` class earlier in the chapter. The implementation appears in [scheme_reader](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scheme_reader.py.html).

The empty list is represented by an object called `nil`, which is an instance of the class `nil`. We assume that only one `nil` instance will ever be created.

The `Pair` class and `nil` object are Scheme values represented in Python. They have `repr` strings that are Python expressions and `str` strings that are Scheme expressions.

```
>>> s = Pair(1, Pair(2, nil))
>>> s
Pair(1, Pair(2, nil))
>>> print(s)
(1 2)
```

They implement the basic Python sequence interface of length and element selection, as well as a `map` method that returns a Scheme list.

```
>>> len(s)
2
>>> s[1]
2
>>> print(s.map(lambda x: x+4))
(5 6)
```

**Nested Lists.** Nested pairs can represent lists, but the elements of a list can also be lists themselves. Pairs are therefore sufficient to represent Scheme expressions, which are in fact nested lists.

```
>>> expr = Pair('+', Pair(Pair('*', Pair(3, Pair(4, nil))), Pair(5, nil)))
>>> print(expr)
(+ (* 3 4) 5)
>>> print(expr.second.first)
(* 3 4)
>>> expr.second.first.second.first
3
```

This example demonstrates that all Calculator expressions are nested Scheme lists. Our Calculator interpreter will read in nested Scheme lists, convert them into expression trees represented as nested `Pair` instances (*Parsing expressions* below), and then evaluate the expression trees to produce values (*Calculator evaluation* below).

### 3.4.3  Parsing Expressions

Parsing is the process of generating expression trees from raw text input.  A parser is a composition of two components: a lexical analyzer and a syntactic analyzer.  First, the *lexical analyzer* partitions the input string into *tokens*, which are the minimal syntactic units of the language such as names and symbols. Second, the *syntactic analyzer* constructs an expression tree from this sequence of tokens.  The sequence of tokens produced by the lexical analyzer is consumed by the syntactic analyzer.

**Lexical analysis.** The component that interprets a string as a token sequence is called a *tokenizer* or *lexical analyzer*. In our implementation, the tokenizer is a function called `tokenize_line` in [scheme_tokens](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scheme_tokens.py.html). Scheme tokens are delimited by white space, parentheses, dots, or single quotation marks.  Delimiters are tokens, as are symbols and numerals. The tokenizer analyzes a line character by character, validating the format of symbols and numerals.

Tokenizing a well-formed Calculator expression separates all symbols and delimiters, but identifies multi-character numbers (e.g., 2.3) and converts them into numeric types.

```
>>> tokenize_line('(+ 1 (* 2.3 45))')
['(', '+', 1, '(', '*', 2.3, 45, ')', ')']
```

Lexical analysis is an iterative process, and it can be applied to each line of an input program in isolation.

**Syntactic analysis.** The component that interprets a token sequence as an expression tree is called a *syntactic analyzer*. Syntactic analysis is a tree-recursive process, and it must consider an entire expression that may span multiple lines.

Syntactic analysis is implemented by the `scheme_read` function in [scheme_reader](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scheme_reader.py.html). It is tree-recursive because analyzing a sequence of tokens often involves analyzing a subsequence of those tokens into a subexpression, which itself serves as a branch (e.g., operand) of a larger expression tree. Recursion generates the hierarchical structures consumed by the evaluator.

The `scheme_read` function expects its input `src` to be a `Buffer` instance that gives access to a sequence of tokens. A `Buffer`, defined in the [buffer](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/buffer.py.html) module, collects tokens that span multiple lines into a single object that can be analyzed syntactically.

```
>>> lines = ['(+ 1', '   (* 2.3 45))']
>>> expression = scheme_read(Buffer(tokenize_lines(lines)))
>>> expression
Pair('+', Pair(1, Pair(Pair('*', Pair(2.3, Pair(45, nil))), nil)))
>>> print(expression)
(+ 1 (* 2.3 45))
```

The `scheme_read` function first checks for various base cases, including empty input (which raises an end-of-file exception, called `EOFError` in Python) and primitive expressions. A recursive call to `read_tail` is invoked whenever a `(` token indicates the beginning of a list.

The `read_tail` function continues to read from the same input `src`, but expects to be called after a list has begun.  Its base cases are an empty input (an error) or a closing parenthesis that terminates the list.  Its recursive call reads the first element of the list with `scheme_read`, reads the rest of the list with `read_tail`, and then returns a list represented as a `Pair`.

This implementation of `scheme_read` can read well-formed Scheme lists, which are all we need for the Calculator language. Parsing dotted lists and quoted forms is left as an exercise.

Informative syntax errors improve the usability of an interpreter substantially. The `SyntaxError` exceptions that are raised include a description of the problem encountered.

### 3.4.4  Calculator Evaluation

The [scalc](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scalc.py.html) module implements an evaluator for the Calculator language.  The `calc_eval` function takes an expression as an argument and returns its value. Definitions of the helper functions `simplify`, `reduce`, and `as_scheme_list` appear in the model and are used below.

For Calculator, the only two legal syntactic forms of expressions are numbers and call expressions, which are `Pair` instances representing well-formed Scheme lists.  Numbers are *self-evaluating*; they can be returned directly from `calc_eval`. Call expressions require function application.

```
>>> def calc_eval(exp):
        """Evaluate a Calculator expression."""
        if type(exp) in (int, float):
            return simplify(exp)
        elif isinstance(exp, Pair):
            arguments = exp.second.map(calc_eval)
            return simplify(calc_apply(exp.first, arguments))
        else:
            raise TypeError(exp + ' is not a number or call expression')
```

Call expressions are evaluated by first recursively mapping the `calc_eval` function to the list of operands, which computes a list of `arguments`. Then, the operator is applied to those arguments in a second function, `calc_apply`.

The Calculator language is simple enough that we can easily express the logic of applying each operator in the body of a single function.  In `calc_apply`, each conditional clause corresponds to applying one operator.

```
>>> def calc_apply(operator, args):
        """Apply the named operator to a list of args."""
        if not isinstance(operator, str):
            raise TypeError(str(operator) + ' is not a symbol')
        if operator == '+':
            return reduce(add, args, 0)
        elif operator == '-':
            if len(args) == 0:
                raise TypeError(operator + ' requires at least 1 argument')
            elif len(args) == 1:
                return -args.first
            else:
                return reduce(sub, args.second, args.first)
        elif operator == '*':
            return reduce(mul, args, 1)
        elif operator == '/':
            if len(args) == 0:
                raise TypeError(operator + ' requires at least 1 argument')
            elif len(args) == 1:
                return 1/args.first
            else:
                return reduce(truediv, args.second, args.first)
        else:
            raise TypeError(operator + ' is an unknown operator')
```

Above, each suite computes the result of a different operator or raises an appropriate `TypeError` when the wrong number of arguments is given. The `calc_apply` function can be applied directly, but it must be passed a list of *values* as arguments rather than a list of operand expressions.

```
>>> calc_apply('+', as_scheme_list(1, 2, 3))
6
>>> calc_apply('-', as_scheme_list(10, 1, 2, 3))
4
>>> calc_apply('*', nil)
1
>>> calc_apply('*', as_scheme_list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
120
>>> calc_apply('/', as_scheme_list(40, 5))
8.0
```

The role of `calc_eval` is to make proper calls to `calc_apply` by first computing the value of operand sub-expressions before passing them as arguments to `calc_apply`. Thus, `calc_eval` can accept a nested expression.

```
>>> print(exp)
(+ (* 3 4) 5)
>>> calc_eval(exp)
17
```

The structure of `calc_eval` is an example of dispatching on type: the form of the expression. The first form of expression is a number, which requires no additional evaluation step. In general, primitive expressions that do not require an additional evaluation step are called *self-evaluating*. The only self-evaluating expressions in our Calculator language are numbers, but a general programming language might also include strings, boolean values, etc.

**Read-eval-print loops.** A typical approach to interacting with an interpreter is through a read-eval-print loop, or REPL, which is a mode of interaction that reads an expression, evaluates it, and prints the result for the user.  The Python interactive session is an example of such a loop.

An implementation of a REPL can be largely independent of the interpreter it uses. The function `read_eval_print_loop` below buffers input from the user, constructs an expression using the language-specific `scheme_read` function, then prints the result of applying `calc_eval` to that expression.

```
>>> def read_eval_print_loop():
        """Run a read-eval-print loop for calculator."""
        while True:
            src = buffer_input()
            while src.more_on_line:
                expression = scheme_read(src)
                print(calc_eval(expression))
```

This version of `read_eval_print_loop` contains all of the essential components of an interactive interface.  An example session would look like:

```
> (* 1 2 3)
6
> (+)
0
> (+ 2 (/ 4 8))
2.5
> (+ 2 2) (* 3 3)
4
9
> (+ 1
     (- 23)
     (* 4 2.5))
-12
```

This loop implementation has no mechanism for termination or error handling. We can improve the interface by reporting errors to the user. We can also allow the user to exit the loop by signalling a keyboard interrupt (`Control-C` on UNIX) or end-of-file exception (`Control-D` on UNIX). To enable these improvements, we place the original suite of the `while` statement within a `try` statement.  The first `except` clause handles `SyntaxError` and `ValueError` exceptions raised by `scheme_read` as well as `TypeError` and `ZeroDivisionError` exceptions raised by `calc_eval`.

```
>>> def read_eval_print_loop():
        """Run a read-eval-print loop for calculator."""
        while True:
            try:
                src = buffer_input()
                while src.more_on_line:
                    expression = scheme_read(src)
                    print(calc_eval(expression))
            except (SyntaxError, TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as err:
                print(type(err).__name__ + ':', err)
            except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError):  # <Control>-D, etc.
                print('Calculation completed.')
                return
```

This loop implementation reports errors without exiting the loop.  Rather than exiting the program on an error, restarting the loop after an error message lets users revise their expressions. Upon importing the `readline` module, users can even recall their previous inputs using the up arrow or `Control-P`. The final result provides an informative error reporting interface:

```
> )
SyntaxError: unexpected token: )
> 2.3.4
ValueError: invalid numeral: 2.3.4
> +
TypeError: + is not a number or call expression
> (/ 5)
TypeError: / requires exactly 2 arguments
> (/ 1 0)
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

As we generalize our interpreter to new languages other than Calculator, we will see that the `read_eval_print_loop` is parameterized by a parsing function, an evaluation function, and the exception types handled by the `try` statement.  Beyond these changes, all REPLs can be implemented using the same structure.

## 3.5  Interpreters for Languages with Abstraction

The Calculator language provides a means of combination through nested call expressions. However, there is no way to define new operators, give names to values, or express general methods of computation. Calculator does not support abstraction in any way. As a result, it is not a particularly powerful or general programming language. We now turn to the task of defining a general programming language that supports abstraction by binding names to values and defining new operations.

Unlike the previous section, which presented a complete interpreter as Python source code, this section takes a descriptive approach. The companion project asks you to implement the ideas presented here by building a fully functional Scheme interpreter.

### 3.5.1  Structure

This section describes the general structure of a Scheme interpreter. Completing that project will produce a working implementation of the interpreter described here.

An interpreter for Scheme can share much of the same structure as the Calculator interpreter.  A parser produces an expression that is interpreted by an evaluator. The evaluation function inspects the form of an expression, and for call expressions it calls a function to apply a procedure to some arguments. Much of the difference in evaluators is associated with special forms, user-defined functions, and implementing the environment model of computation.

**Parsing.** The [scheme_reader](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scheme_reader.py.html) and [scheme_tokens](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scheme_tokens.py.html) modules from the Calculator interpreter are nearly sufficient to parse any valid Scheme expression. However, it does not yet support quotation or dotted lists.  A full Scheme interpreter should be able to parse the following input expression.

```
>>> read_line("(car '(1 . 2))")
Pair('car', Pair(Pair('quote', Pair(Pair(1, 2), nil)), nil))
```

Your first task in implementing the Scheme interpreter will be to extend [scheme_reader](http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scheme_reader.py.html) to correctly parse dotted lists and quotation.

**Evaluation.** Scheme is evaluated one expression at a time. A skeleton implementation of the evaluator is defined in `scheme.py` of the companion project. Each expression returned from `scheme_read` is passed to the `scheme_eval` function, which evaluates an expression `expr` in the current environment `env`.

The `scheme_eval` function evaluates the different forms of expressions in Scheme: primitives, special forms, and call expressions.  The form of a combination in Scheme can be determined by inspecting its first element.  Each special form has its own evaluation rule.  A simplified implementation of `scheme_eval` appears below. Some error checking and special form handling has been removed in order to focus our discussion. A complete implementation appears in the companion project.

```
>>> def scheme_eval(expr, env):
        """Evaluate Scheme expression expr in environment env."""
        if scheme_symbolp(expr):
            return env[expr]
        elif scheme_atomp(expr):
            return expr
        first, rest = expr.first, expr.second
        if first == "lambda":
            return do_lambda_form(rest, env)
        elif first == "define":
            do_define_form(rest, env)
            return None
        else:
            procedure = scheme_eval(first, env)
            args = rest.map(lambda operand: scheme_eval(operand, env))
            return scheme_apply(procedure, args, env)
```

**Procedure application.** The final case above invokes a second process, procedure application, that is implemented by the function `scheme_apply`. The procedure application process in Scheme is considerably more general than the `calc_apply` function in Calculator. It applies two kinds of arguments: a `PrimtiveProcedure` or a `LambdaProcedure`. A `PrimitiveProcedure` is implemented in Python; it has an instance attribute `fn` that is bound to a Python function. In addition, it may or may not require access to the current environment. This Python function is called whenever the procedure is applied.

A `LambdaProcedure` is implemented in Scheme.  It has a `body` attribute that is a Scheme expression, evaluated whenever the procedure is applied. To apply the procedure to a list of arguments, the body expression is evaluated in a new environment.  To construct this environment, a new frame is added to the environment, in which the formal parameters of the procedure are bound to the arguments. The body is evaluated using `scheme_eval`.

**Eval/apply recursion.** The functions that implement the evaluation process, `scheme_eval` and `scheme_apply`, are **mutually recursive**. <u>Evaluation requires application whenever a call expression is encountered.  Application uses evaluation to evaluate operand expressions into arguments, as well as to evaluate the body of user-defined procedures.</u> The general structure of this mutually recursive process appears in interpreters quite generally: evaluation is defined in terms of application and application is defined in terms of evaluation.

This recursive cycle ends with language primitives. Evaluation has a base case that is evaluating a primitive expression. Some special forms also constitute base cases without recursive calls. Function application has a base case that is applying a primitive procedure. This mutually recursive structure, between an eval function that processes expression forms and an apply function that processes functions and their arguments, constitutes the essence of the evaluation process.

### 3.5.2  Environments

Now that we have described the structure of our Scheme interpreter, we turn to implementing the `Frame` class that forms environments. Each `Frame` instance represents an environment in which symbols are bound to values. A frame has a dictionary of `bindings`, as well as a `parent` frame that is `None` for the global frame.

Bindings are not accessed directly, but instead through two `Frame` methods: `lookup` and `define`. The first implements the look-up procedure of the environment model of computation described in Chapter 1. A symbol is matched against the `bindings` of the current frame.  If it is found, the value to which it is bound is returned. If it is not found, look-up proceeds to the `parent` frame.  On the other hand, the `define` method always binds a symbol to a value in the current frame.

The implementation of `lookup` and the use of `define` are left as exercises.  As an illustration of their use, consider the following example Scheme program:

```
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))


(factorial 5)
```

120

The first input expression is a `define` special form, evaluated by the `do_define_form` Python function.  Defining a function has several steps:

1. Check the format of the expression to ensure that it is a well-formed Scheme list with at least two elements following the keyword `define`.
2. Analyze the first element, in this case a `Pair`, to find the function name `factorial` and formal parameter list `(n)`.
3. Create a `LambdaProcedure` with the supplied formal parameters, body, and parent environment.
4. Bind the symbol `factorial` to this function, in the first frame of the current environment. In this case, the environment consists only of the global frame.

The second input is a call expression. The `procedure` passed to `scheme_apply` is the `LambdaProcedure` just created and bound to the symbol `factorial`. The `args` passed is a one-element Scheme list `(5)`. To apply the procedure, a new frame is created that extends the global frame (the parent environment of the `factorial` procedure).  In this frame, the symbol `n` is bound to the value 5. Then, the body of `factorial` is evaluated in that environment, and its value is returned.

### 3.5.3  Data as Programs

In thinking about a program that evaluates Scheme expressions, an analogy might be helpful. **One operational view of the meaning of a program is that a program is a description of an abstract machine.** For example, consider again this procedure to compute factorials:

```
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

We could express an equivalent program in Python as well, using a conditional expression.

```
>>> def factorial(n):
        return 1 if n == 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
```

We may regard this program as the description of a machine containing parts that decrement, multiply, and test for equality, together with a two-position switch and another factorial machine. (The factorial machine is infinite because it contains another factorial machine within it.) The figure below is a flow diagram for the factorial machine, showing how the parts are wired together.

![image-20211214225723096](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211214225723096.png)

In a similar way, **we can regard the Scheme interpreter as a very special machine that takes as input a description of a machine.** Given this input, the interpreter configures itself to emulate the machine described. For example, if we feed our evaluator the definition of factorial the evaluator will be able to compute factorials.

From this perspective, our Scheme interpreter is seen to be a <u>universal machine</u>. It mimics other machines when these are described as Scheme programs. <u>It acts as a bridge between the data objects that are manipulated by our programming language and the programming language itself.</u> Image that a user types a Scheme expression into our running Scheme interpreter. From the perspective of the user, an input expression such as `(+ 2 2)` is an expression in the programming language, which the interpreter should evaluate. From the perspective of the Scheme interpreter, however, the expression is simply a sentence of words that is to be manipulated according to a well-defined set of rules.

**That the user's programs are the interpreter's data need not be a source of confusion.** In fact, it is sometimes convenient to ignore this distinction, and to give the user the ability to explicitly evaluate a data object as an expression. In Scheme, we use this facility whenever employing the `run` procedure.  Similar functions exist in Python: the `eval` function will evaluate a Python expression and the `exec` function will execute a Python statement. Thus,

```
>>> eval('2+2')
4
```

and

```
>>> 2+2
4
```

both return the same result. **Evaluating expressions that are constructed as a part of execution is a common and powerful feature in dynamic programming languages. In few languages is this practice as common as in Scheme, but the ability to construct and evaluate expressions during the course of execution of a program can prove to be a valuable tool for any programmer.**

# Chapter 4: Data Processing

## 4.1  Introduction

Modern computers can process vast amounts of data representing many aspects of the world.  From these big data sets, we can learn about human behavior in unprecedented ways: how language is used, what photos are taken, what topics are discussed, and how people engage with their surroundings.  **To process large data sets efficiently, programs are organized into pipelines of manipulations on sequential streams of data.** In this chapter, we consider a suite of techniques process and manipulate sequential data streams efficiently.

In Chapter 2, we introduced a sequence interface, implemented in Python by built-in data types such as `list` and `range`. In this chapter, we extend the concept of sequential data to include collections that have unbounded or even infinite size. Two mathematical examples of infinite sequences are the positive integers and the Fibonacci numbers. Sequential data sets of unbounded length also appear in other computational domains. For instance, the sequence of telephone calls sent through a cell tower, the sequence of mouse movements made by a computer user, and the sequence of acceleration measurements from sensors on an aircraft all continue to grow as the world evolves.

## 4.3  Declarative Programming

In addition to streams, data values are often stored in large repositories called databases.  A database consists of a data store containing the data values along with an interface for retrieving and transforming those values. Each value stored in a database is called a ***record***. Records with similar structure are grouped into tables. Records are retrieved and transformed using queries, which are statements in a query language.  By far the most ubiquitous query language in use today is called Structured Query Language or SQL (pronounced "**sequel**").

SQL is an example of a **declarative programming language**. Statements do not describe computations directly, but instead describe the desired result of some computation.  It is the role of the *query interpreter* of the database system to design and perform a computational process to produce such a result.

This interaction differs substantially from the procedural programming paradigm of Python or Scheme. In Python, computational processes are described directly by the programmer. A declarative language abstracts away procedural details, instead focusing on the form of the result.

### 4.3.1  Tables

The SQL language is standardized, but most database systems implement some custom variant of the language that is endowed with proprietary features. In this text, we will describe a small subset of SQL as it is implemented in [Sqlite](http://sqlite.org). You can follow along by [downloading Sqlite](http://sqlite.org/download.html) or by using this [online SQL interpreter](http://kripken.github.io/sql.js/GUI/).

A table, also called a *relation*, has a fixed number of named and typed columns. Each row of a table represents a data record and has one value for each column. For example, a table of cities might have columns `latitude` `longitude` that both hold numeric values, as well as a column `name` that holds a string. Each row would represent a city location position by its latitude and longitude values.

| **Latitude** | **Longitude** | **Name**    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| 38           | 122           | Berkeley    |
| 42           | 71            | Cambridge   |
| 45           | 93            | Minneapolis |

A table with a single row can be created in the SQL language using a `select` statement, in which the row values are separated by commas and the column names follow the keyword "as". All SQL statements end in a semicolon.

```
sqlite> select 38 as latitude, 122 as longitude, "Berkeley" as name;
38|122|Berkeley
```

The second line is the output, which includes one line per row with columns separated by a vertical bar.

A multi-line table can be constructed by union, which combines the rows of two tables. The column names of the left table are used in the constructed table. Spacing within a line does not affect the result.

```
sqlite> select 38 as latitude, 122 as longitude, "Berkeley" as name union
   ...> select 42,             71,               "Cambridge"        union
   ...> select 45,             93,               "Minneapolis";
38|122|Berkeley
42|71|Cambridge
45|93|Minneapolis
```

A table can be given a name using a `create table` statement. While this statement can also be used to create empty tables, we will focus on the form that gives a name to an existing table defined by a `select` statement.

```
sqlite> create table cities as
   ...>    select 38 as latitude, 122 as longitude, "Berkeley" as name union
   ...>    select 42,             71,               "Cambridge"        union
   ...>    select 45,             93,               "Minneapolis";
```

Once a table is named, that name can be used in a `from` clause within a `select` statement. All columns of a table can be displayed using the special `select *` form.

```
sqlite> select * from cities;
38|122|Berkeley
42|71|Cambridge
45|93|Minneapolis
```

### 4.3.2  Select Statements

A `select` statement defines a new table either by listing the values in a single row or, more commonly, by projecting an existing table using a `from` clause:

```
select [column description] from [existing table name]
```

The columns of the resulting table are described by a comma-separated list of expressions that are each evaluated for each row of the existing input table.

For example, we can create a two-column table that describes each city by how far north or south it is of Berkeley. Each degree of latitude measures 60 nautical miles to the north.

```
sqlite> select name, 60*abs(latitude-38) from cities;
Berkeley|0
Cambridge|240
Minneapolis|420
```

Column descriptions are expressions in a language that shares many properties with Python: infix operators such as + and %, built-in functions such as `abs` and `round`, and parentheses that describe evaluation order. Names in these expressions, such as `latitude` above, evaluate to the column value in the row being projected.

Optionally, each expression can be followed by the keyword `as` and a column name. When the entire table is given a name, it is often helpful to give each column a name so that it can be referenced in future `select` statements. Columns described by a simple name are named automatically.

```
sqlite> create table distances as
   ...>   select name, 60*abs(latitude-38) as distance from cities;
sqlite> select distance/5, name from distances;
0|Berkeley
48|Cambridge
84|Minneapolis
```

**Where Clauses.** A `select` statement can also include a `where` clause with a filtering expression. This expression filters the rows that are projected. Only a row for which the filtering expression evaluates to a true value will be used to produce a row in the resulting table.

```
sqlite> create table cold as
   ...>   select name from cities where latitude > 43;
sqlite> select name, "is cold!" from cold;
Minneapolis|is cold!
```

**Order Clauses.** A `select` statement can also express an ordering over the resulting table. An `order` clause contains an ordering expression that is evaluated for each unfiltered row. The resulting values of this expression are used as a sorting criterion for the result table.

```
sqlite> select distance, name from distances order by -distance;
84|Minneapolis
48|Cambridge
0|Berkeley
```

The combination of these features allows a `select` statement to express a wide range of projections of an input table into a related output table.

### 4.3.3  Joins

Databases typically contain multiple tables, and queries can require information contained within different tables to compute a desired result. For instance, we may have a second table describing the mean daily high temperature of different cities.

```
sqlite> create table temps as
   ...>   select "Berkeley" as city, 68 as temp union
   ...>   select "Chicago"         , 59         union
   ...>   select "Minneapolis"     , 55;
```

Data are combined by *joining* multiple tables together into one, a fundamental operation in database systems. There are many methods of joining, all closely related, but we will focus on just one method in this text. When tables are joined, the resulting table contains a new row for each combination of rows in the input tables. If two tables are joined and the left table has mm rows and the right table has nn rows, then the joined table will have m⋅nm \cdot n rows. Joins are expressed in SQL by separating table names by commas in the `from` clause of a `select` statement.

```
sqlite> select * from cities, temps;
38|122|Berkeley|Berkeley|68
38|122|Berkeley|Chicago|59
38|122|Berkeley|Minneapolis|55
42|71|Cambridge|Berkeley|68
42|71|Cambridge|Chicago|59
42|71|Cambridge|Minneapolis|55
45|93|Minneapolis|Berkeley|68
45|93|Minneapolis|Chicago|59
45|93|Minneapolis|Minneapolis|55
```

Joins are typically accompanied by a `where` clause that expresses a relationship between the two tables. For example, if we wanted to collect data into a table that would allow us to correlate latitude and temperature, we would select rows from the join where the same city is mentioned in each. Within the `cities` table, the city name is stored in a column called `name`. Within the `temps` table, the city name is stored in a column called `city`. The `where` clause can select for rows in the joined table in which these values are equal. In SQL, numeric equality is tested with a single `=` symbol.

```
sqlite> select name, latitude, temp from cities, temps where name = city;
Berkeley|38|68
Minneapolis|45|55
```

Tables may have overlapping column names, and so we need a method for disambiguating column names by table. A table may also be joined with itself, and so we need a method for disambiguating tables. To do so, SQL allows us to give aliases to tables within a `from` clause using the keyword `as` and to refer to a column within a particular table using a dot expression. The following `select` statement computes the temperature difference between pairs of unequal cities. The alphabetical ordering constraint in the `where` clause ensures that each pair will only appear once in the result.

```
sqlite> select a.city, b.city, a.temp - b.temp
   ...>        from temps as a, temps as b where a.city < b.city;
Berkeley|Chicago|10
Berkeley|Minneapolis|15
Chicago|Minneapolis|5
```

Our two means of combining tables in SQL, join and union, allow for a great deal of expressive power in the language.

### 4.3.4  Interpreting SQL

In order to create an interpreter for the subset of SQL we have introduced so far, we need to create a representation for tables, a parser for statements written as text, and an evaluator for parsed statements. The [sql](http://composingprograms.com/examples/sql/sql_exec.py) interpreter example includes all of these components, providing a simple but functional demonstration of a declarative language interpreter.

In this implementation, each table has its own a class, and each row in a table is represented by an instance of its table's class. A row has one attribute per column in the table, and a table is a sequence of rows.

The class for a table is created using the [namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) function in the `collections` package of the Python standard library, which returns a new sub-class of `tuple` that gives names to each element in the tuple.

Consider the `cities` table from the previous section, repeated below.

```
sqlite> create table cities as
   ...>    select 38 as latitude, 122 as longitude, "Berkeley" as name union
   ...>    select 42,             71,               "Cambridge"        union
   ...>    select 45,             93,               "Minneapolis";
```

The following Python statements construct a representation for this table.

```
>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> CitiesRow = namedtuple("Row", ["latitude", "longitude", "name"])
>>> cities = [CitiesRow(38, 122, "Berkeley"),
              CitiesRow(42,  71, "Cambridge"),
              CitiesRow(43,  93, "Minneapolis")]
```

The result of a `select` statement can be interpreted using sequence operations. Consider the `distances` table from the previous section, repeated below.

```
sqlite> create table distances as
   ...>   select name, 60*abs(latitude-38) as distance from cities;
sqlite> select distance/5, name from distances;
0|Berkeley
48|Cambridge
84|Minneapolis
```

This table is generated from the `name` and `latitude` columns of the `cities` table. This resulting table can be generated by mapping a function over the rows of the input table, a function that returns a `DistancesRow` for each `CitiesRow`.

```
>>> DistancesRow = namedtuple("Row", ["name", "distance"])
>>> def select(cities_row):
        latitude, longitude, name = cities_row
        return DistancesRow(name, 60*abs(latitude-38))
>>> distances = list(map(select, cities))
>>> for row in distances:
        print(row)
Row(name='Berkeley', distance=0)
Row(name='Cambridge', distance=240)
Row(name='Minneapolis', distance=300)
```

The design of our SQL interpreter generalizes this approach. A `select` statement is represented as an instance of a class `Select` that is constructed from the clauses of the select statement.

```
>>> class Select:
        """select [columns] from [tables] where [condition] order by [order]."""
        def __init__(self, columns, tables, condition, order):
            self.columns = columns
            self.tables = tables
            self.condition = condition
            self.order = order
            self.make_row = create_make_row(self.columns)
        def execute(self, env):
            """Join, filter, sort, and map rows from tables to columns."""
            from_rows = join(self.tables, env)
            filtered_rows = filter(self.filter, from_rows)
            ordered_rows = self.sort(filtered_rows)
            return map(self.make_row, ordered_rows)
        def filter(self, row):
            if self.condition:
                return eval(self.condition, row)
            else:
                return True
        def sort(self, rows):
            if self.order:
                return sorted(rows, key=lambda r: eval(self.order, r))
            else:
                return rows
```

The `execute` method joins input tables, filters and orders the resulting rows, then maps a function called `make_row` over those resulting rows. The `make_row` function is created in the `Select` constructor by a call to `create_make_row`, a higher-order function that creates a new class for the resulting table and defines how to project an input row to an output row. (A version of this function with more error handling and special cases appears in [sql](http://composingprograms.com/examples/sql/sql_exec.py).)

```
>>> def create_make_row(description):
        """Return a function from an input environment (dict) to an output row.
        description -- a comma-separated list of [expression] as [column name]
        """
        columns = description.split(", ")
        expressions, names = [], []
        for column in columns:
            if " as " in column:
                expression, name = column.split(" as ")
            else:
                expression, name = column, column
            expressions.append(expression)
            names.append(name)
        row = namedtuple("Row", names)
        return lambda env: row(*[eval(e, env) for e in expressions])
```

Finally, we need to define the `join` function that creates the input rows. Given an `env` dictionary contains existing tables (lists of rows) keyed by their name, the `join` function groups together all combinations of rows in the input tables using the [product](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product) function in the `itertools` package. It maps a function called `make_env` over the joined rows, a function that converts each combination of rows into a dictionary so that it can be used to evaluate expressions. (A version of this function with more error handling and special cases appears in [sql](http://composingprograms.com/examples/sql/sql_exec.py).)

```
>>> from itertools import product
>>> def join(tables, env):
        """Return an iterator over dictionaries from names to values in a row.
        tables -- a comma-separate sequences of table names
        env    -- a dictionary from global names to tables
        """
        names = tables.split(", ")
        joined_rows = product(*[env[name] for name in names])
        return map(lambda rows: make_env(rows, names), joined_rows)
>>> def make_env(rows, names):
        """Create an environment of names bound to values."""
        env = dict(zip(names, rows))
        for row in rows:
            for name in row._fields:
                env[name] = getattr(row, name)
        return env
```

Above, `row._fields` evaluates to the column names of the table containing the `row`. The `_fields` attribute exists because the type of `row` is a `namedtuple` class.

Our interpreter is complete enough to execute `select` statements. For instance, we can compute the latitude distance from Berkeley for all other cities, ordered by their longitude.

```
>>> env = {"cities": cities}
>>> select = Select("name, 60*abs(latitude-38) as distance",
                    "cities", "name != 'Berkeley'", "-longitude")
>>> for row in select.execute(env):
        print(row)
Row(name='Minneapolis', distance=300)
Row(name='Cambridge', distance=240)
```

The example above is equivalent to the following SQL statement.

```
sqlite> select name, 60*abs(latitude-38) as distance
   ...>        from cities where name != "Berkeley" order by -longitude;
Minneapolis|420
Cambridge|240
```

We can also store this resulting table in the environment and join it with the `cities` table, retrieving the longitude for each city.

```
>>> env["distances"] = list(select.execute(env))
>>> joined = Select("cities.name as name, distance, longitude", "cities, distances",
                    "cities.name == distances.name", None)
>>> for row in joined.execute(env):
        print(row)
Row(name='Cambridge', distance=240, longitude=71)
Row(name='Minneapolis', distance=300, longitude=93)
```

The example above is equivalent to the following SQL statement.

```
sqlite> select cities.name as name, distance, longitude
   ...>        from cities, distances where cities.name = distances.name;
Cambridge|240|71
Minneapolis|420|93
```

The full [sql](http://composingprograms.com/examples/sql/sql_exec.py) example program also contains a simple parser for `select` statements, as well as `execute` methods for `create table` and `union`. The interpreter can correctly execute all SQL statements included within the text so far. While this simple interpreter only implements a small amount of the full Structured Query Language, its structure demonstrates the relationship between sequence processing operations and query languages.

**Query Plans.** Declarative languages describe the form of a result, but do not explicitly describe how that result should be computed. This interpreter always joins, filters, orders, and then projects the input rows in order to compute the result rows. However, more efficient ways to compute the same result may exist, and query interpreters are free to choose among them. Choosing efficient procedures for computing query results is a core feature of database systems.

For example, consider the final select statement above. Rather than computing the join of `cities` and `distances` and then filtering the result, the same result may be computed by first sorting both tables by the `name` column and then joining only the rows that have the same name in a linear pass through the sorted tables. When tables are large, efficiency gains from query plan selection can be substantial.

### 4.3.5  Recursive Select Statements

Select statements can optionally include a `with` clause that generates and names additional tables used in computing the final result. The full syntax of a select statement, not including unions, has the following form:

```
with [tables] select [columns] from [names] where [condition] order by [order]
```

We have already demonstrated the allowed values for `[columns]` and `[names]`. `[condition]` and `[order]` are expressions that can be evaluated for an input row. The `[tables]` portion is a comma-separated list of table descriptions of the form:

```
[table name]([column names]) as ([select statement])
```

Any `select` statement can be used to describe a table within `[tables]`.

For instance, the `with` clause below declares a table `states` containing cities and their states. The `select` statement computes pairs of cities within the same state.

```
sqlite> with
   ...>   states(city, state) as (
   ...>     select "Berkeley",  "California"    union
   ...>     select "Boston",    "Massachusetts" union
   ...>     select "Cambridge", "Massachusetts" union
   ...>     select "Chicago",   "Illinois"      union
   ...>     select "Pasadena",  "California"
   ...>   )
   ...> select a.city, b.city, a.state from states as a, states as b
   ...>        where a.state = b.state and a.city < b.city;
Berkeley|Pasadena|California
Boston|Cambridge|Massachusetts
```

A table defined within a `with` clause may have a single recursive case that defines output rows in terms of other output rows. For example, the `with` clause below defines a table of integers from 5 to 15, of which the odd values are selected and squared.

```
sqlite> with
   ...>   ints(n) as (
   ...>     select 5 union
   ...>     select n+1 from ints where n < 15
   ...>   )
   ...> select n, n*n from ints where n % 2 = 1;
5|25
7|49
9|81
11|121
13|169
15|225
```

Multiple tables can be defined in a `with` clause, separated by commas. The example below computes all Pythagorean triples from a table of integers, their squares, and the sums of pairs of squares. A Pythagorean triple consists of integers aa, bb, and cc such that a2+b2=c2a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

```
sqlite> with
   ...>   ints(n) as (
   ...>     select 1 union select n+1 from ints where n < 20
   ...>   ),
   ...>   squares(x, xx) as (
   ...>     select n, n*n from ints
   ...>   ),
   ...>   sum_of_squares(a, b, sum) as (
   ...>     select a.x, b.x, a.xx + b.xx
   ...>            from squares as a, squares as b where a.x < b.x
   ...>   )
   ...> select a, b, x from squares, sum_of_squares where sum = xx;
3|4|5
6|8|10
5|12|13
9|12|15
8|15|17
12|16|20
```

Designing recursive queries involves ensuring that the appropriate information is available in each input row to compute a result row. To compute Fibonacci numbers, for example, the input row needs not only the current but also the previous element in order to compute the next element.

```
sqlite> with
   ...>   fib(previous, current) as (
   ...>     select 0, 1 union
   ...>     select current, previous+current from fib
   ...>     where current <= 100
   ...>   )
   ...> select previous from fib;
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
89
```

These examples demonstrate that recursion is a powerful means of combination, even in declarative languages.

**Building strings**. Two strings can be concatenated into a longer string using the `||` operator in SQL.

```
sqlite> with wall(n) as (
  ....>   select 99 union select 98 union select 97
  ....> )
  ....> select n || " bottles" from wall;
99 bottles
98 bottles
97 bottles
```

This feature can be used to construct sentences by concatenating phrases. For example, one way to construct an English sentence is to concatenate a subject noun phrase, a verb, and an object noun phrase.

```
sqlite> create table nouns as
  ....>   select "the dog" as phrase union
  ....>   select "the cat"           union
  ....>   select "the bird";
sqlite> select subject.phrase || " chased " || object.phrase
  ....>        from nouns as subject, nouns as object
  ....>        where subject.phrase != object.phrase;
the bird chased the cat
the bird chased the dog
the cat chased the bird
the cat chased the dog
the dog chased the bird
the dog chased the cat
```

As an exercise, use a recursive local table to generate sentences such as, "the dog that chased the cat that chased the bird also chased the bird."

### 4.3.6  Aggregation and Grouping

The `select` statements introduced so far can join, project, and manipulate individual rows. In addition, a `select` statement can perform aggregation operations over multiple rows. The aggregate functions `max`, `min`, `count`, and `sum` return the maximum, minimum, number, and sum of the values in a column. Multiple aggregate functions can be applied to the same set of rows by defining more than one column. Only columns that are included by the `where` clause are considered in the aggreagation.

```
sqlite> create table animals as
  ....>   select "dog" as name, 4 as legs, 20 as weight union
  ....>   select "cat"        , 4        , 10           union
  ....>   select "ferret"     , 4        , 10           union
  ....>   select "t-rex"      , 2        , 12000        union
  ....>   select "penguin"    , 2        , 10           union
  ....>   select "bird"       , 2        , 6;
sqlite> select max(legs) from animals;
4
sqlite> select sum(weight) from animals;
12056
sqlite> select min(legs), max(weight) from animals where name <> "t-rex";
2|20
```

The `distinct` keyword ensures that no repeated values in a column are included in the aggregation. Only two distinct values of `legs` appear in the `animals` table. The special `count(*)` syntax counts the number of rows.

```
sqlite> select count(legs) from animals;
6
sqlite> select count(*) from animals;
6
sqlite> select count(distinct legs) from animals;
2
```

Each of these `select` statements has produced a table with a single row. The `group by` and `having` clauses of a `select` statement are used to partition rows into groups and select only a subset of the groups. Any aggregate functions in the `having` clause or column description will apply to each group independently, rather than the entire set of rows in the table.

For example, to compute the maximum weight of both a four-legged and a two-legged animal from this table, the first statement below groups together dogs and cats as one group and birds as a separate group. The result indicates that the maximum weight for a two-legged animal is 3 (the bird) and for a four-legged animal is 20 (the dog). The second query lists the values in the `legs` column for which there are at least two distinct names.

```
sqlite> select legs, max(weight) from animals group by legs;
2|12000
4|20
sqlite> select weight from animals group by weight having count(*)>1;
10
```

Multiple columns and full expressions can appear in the `group by` clause, and groups will be formed for every unique combination of values that result. Typically, the expression used for grouping also appears in the column description, so that it is easy to identify which result row resulted from each group.

```
sqlite> select max(name) from animals group by legs, weight order by name;
bird
dog
ferret
penguin
t-rex
sqlite> select max(name), legs, weight from animals group by legs, weight
  ....>   having max(weight) < 100;
bird|2|6
penguin|2|10
ferret|4|10
dog|4|20
sqlite> select count(*), weight/legs from animals group by weight/legs;
2|2
1|3
2|5
1|6000
```

A `having` clause can contain the same filtering as a `where` clause, but can also include calls to aggregate functions. For the fastest execution and clearest use of the language, a condition that filters individual rows based on their contents should appear in a `where` clause, while a `having` clause should be used only when aggregation is required in the condition (such as specifying a minimum `count` for a group).

When using a `group by` clause, column descriptions can contain expressions that do not aggregate. In some cases, the SQL interpreter will choose the value from a row that corresponds to another column that includes aggregation. For example, the following statement gives the `name` of an animal with maximal `weight`.

```
sqlite> select name, max(weight) from animals;
t-rex|12000
sqlite> select name, legs, max(weight) from animals group by legs;
t-rex|2|12000
dog|4|20
```

However, whenever the row that corresponds to aggregation is unclear (for instance, when aggregating with `count` instead of `max`), the value chosen may be arbitrary. For the clearest and most predictable use of the language, a `select` statement that includes a `group by` clause should include at least one aggregate column and only include non-aggregate columns if their contents is predictable from the aggregation.

## SQL

slow when: doing tons of arithmetic, many computers try to access database at once
