## Overview

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

1. CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
2. CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
3. CS 61C focuses on machines and how they execute programs.

In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. We will also use two other languages in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).

Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of CS 61A. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in your future endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the concepts involved in programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.

So, you're going to be writing code and that's sort of part but not all of what this course is about. A lot of this course is also how to think computationally. How to think about approaching a problem in a systematic and quantitative and logical way, and solving the problem.

One of the powers of code is that it is arguably one of the most powerful techniques for taking an idea in your head and translating it into something that you can actually do. The only things that limit you are your imagination and your skill set. 

And the job of this class and subsequent classes is to expand on your skill set, is to give you these really raw basic tools that allow you to think about the nature of computation and how you can solve problems. And our goal is to teach you those very generic skills and help you apply those to solve interesting and important, fun, exciting problems as you move forward in your career.

All these parts of the course just help you practice and get better and learn and the point of the course is to practice and get better and learn.

> how do we teach such a course?

Part of it's learning to program, but another part of it is to deal with the common enemy of all computer scientists. When you want to do something interesting in any one of these fields, then you have to wrestle with complexity. We do have a common tool in our battle against complexity, and that is called abstraction. My take on abstraction is: what it means is you're giving a name to something that's complicated and not worrying about its parts.

We talk about functions for a few weeks and then values and then objects and then interpreters and then data.

## Assignments

### Labs

Lab exercises are designed to introduce a new topic.

Labs are the most important part of the course because the course is about learning to solve problems, and you need to practice. And the way you practice is to work on some problems in lab.

### Homework

Weekly homework assignments let you apply the concepts learned in lecture and section to more challenging problems. 

### Projects

Projects are larger assignments intended to combine ideas from the course in interesting ways. 

Projects are graded on both correctness and [composition](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/articles/composition.html).

## Discussion/Tutorials

Tutorials are different from lab because you don't need a computer. The goal here is to be able to think through problems yourself without using the computer to tell you whether you are right or wrong. And this is a tremendously important skill when you're learning about computer science, when you're learning to program. To be able to figure out whether something works on your own, with your mind, without relying on the computer to do everything for you.

## Textbook

The online textbook for the course is [Composing Programs](http://composingprograms.com/), which was created specifically for this course, based on the classic textbook [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html). Readings for each lecture appear in the course schedule. We recommend that you complete the readings before attending lecture.

## Learning Cooperatively

One of the best things you can learn how to do in college is explain stuff to other people, especially technical stuff.

I think that the best way to learn how to do something is to find somebody who knows more about it than you
and have them coach you along a little bit. They won't tell you the answer but they'll tell you how to proceed.

With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

You are also welcome to code collaboratively with others in your lab and solve lab problems in small groups.

Learning cooperatively is different from sharing answers. You shouldn't be showing your code to other students or looking at others' code, except:

- During lab, you can share all you want as long as you're all learning.
- For a project that allows partners, you can share anything with your partner.
- If you've finished a problem already, you can look at others' code to help them finish.

If you are helping another student, don't just tell them the answer; they will learn very little and run into trouble on exams. Instead, try to guide them toward discovering the solution on their own. **Problem solving practice is the key to progress in computer science.**

And the course staff is really not there to judge you. We're here to help you get the most out of this class that you can.
So, you know, treat the course staff that way. And in particular, don't be afraid to engage with the course staff. Ask questions. They really do want to support your success.

**The the process of failure, the process of struggling, the process of taking hours to solve something is where the learning is happening. And so don't be frustrated by things not working. That's what the process of learning is and it's okay. But if you're stuck somewhere for six hours, don't be stuck by yourself, ask somebody.**

## Academic Honesty

- Do not copy code from any student who is not your partner.
- Do not allow any student other than your partner to copy code from you.
- Do not copy solutions from online sources such as Stack Overflow, Pastebin, and public repositories on GitHub.
- Do not post your solutions publicly during or after the semester.

In summary, we expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and complete your own projects. The assignments and evaluations are structured to help you learn, which is why you are here.

Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

When you go out there in the world and are solving a real problem, there will be no answers to copy. So you've got to learn how to solve stuff for yourself. That's why you're in school.

## Secrets to Success in CS 61A

CS 61A is definitely a challenge, but we all want you to learn and succeed, so here is a collection of various tips that might help in your journey:

- Ask questions. If you encounter something you don't know or aren't sure about a concept or problem, *ask* away. We're here to help you learn, and if you ask a question, that tells us where we can help with your understanding of the material. The process of asking questions itself can also be helpful in figuring out for yourself what you would specifically like to ask about, and in therefore pinpointing concepts that you believe you can learn more about.
- Study in groups. Again, this class is not trivial; you might feel overwhelmed going at it alone. Send a message and reach out to other students in the class; work together on assignments or study together to prepare for exams, as long as you don't violate the course policy on Academic Honesty as stated in the [Syllabus](https://cs61a.org/articles/about/#academic-honesty).
- When stuck on a problem, try to explain the area in which you are stuck. This doesn't need to require a person who understands how to solve the problem (or even a person - this practice is often referred to as **rubber ducking** since you can take a rubber duck and consider it your practice audience) because the main goal is for you to clarify your own thoughts and figure out where exactly you're getting stuck with your understanding and code. From there you can focus on that portion to better your understanding.
- If you're still feeling stuck, feel free to make use of the class [Piazza](https://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2021/cs61a) (our course forum for asking and answering questions) or attend office hours.
- Office hours gives you time with the instructors or staff by themselves, and you will be able to get some (nearly) one-on-one instruction. You are *not* intruding; the instructors and staff are here to help as you learn.
- Do (or at least attempt seriously) all the homework. We do not give many homework problems, but those we do give you may find are challenging, time-consuming, and rewarding.
- Do all the lab exercises. Most of them are designed as more of an introduction to the course material, and may take around the length of a lab section. This is a great time to get acquainted with new material. Feel free to ask the staff members in your lab section or come to office hours if you would like more guidance.
- Optional lab questions are 'optional' in the sense that they are extra practice, not that they are material that's out of scope. Make sure you do them if you have time.
- Do the readings before lecture. They can be helpful in offering an overview of the material covered in lecture and other aspects of the class, as well as being a reference as part of the overall textbook that you can refer to as you go through the course.
- When preparing for the exams, **do past exam questions**! Lecture, lab, and discussion provide a great introduction to the material, but the main way to learn how to solve exam-level problems is to do exam-level problems. You can find past exams (and other resources) under the [Resources](https://cs61a.org/resources/) tab of the website. Many past exams also have solutions or walkthrough videos where past staff members may walk you through the solution to the exam.

## A Parting Thought

Grades and penalties aren't the purpose of this course. We really just want you to learn. The entire staff is very excited to be teaching CS 61A this semester and we're looking forward to meeting such a large and enthusiastic group of students. We want all of you to be successful here. Welcome to CS 61A!
