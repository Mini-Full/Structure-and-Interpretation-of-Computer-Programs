## Recursion

A recursive function is a function that calls itself in its body, either directly or indirectly.

Let's look at the canonical example, `factorial`.

> Factorial, denoted with the `!` operator, is defined as:
>
> ```
> n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 1
> ```
>
> For example, `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

The recursive implementation for factorial is as follows:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

We know from its definition that 0! is 1. Since `n == 0` is the smallest number we can compute the factorial of, we use it as our base case. The recursive step also follows from the definition of factorial, i.e., `n! = n * (n-1)!`.

Recursive functions have three important components:

1. **Base case.** You can think of the base case as the case of the simplest function input,  or as the stopping condition for the recursion.

   In our example, `factorial(1)` is our base case for the `factorial`  function.

2. **Recursive call on a smaller problem.**  You can think of this step as calling the function on a smaller problem  that our current problem depends on. We assume that a recursive call on  this smaller problem will give us the expected result; we call this idea  the "recursive leap of faith".

   In our example, `factorial(n)` depends on the smaller problem of  `factorial(n-1)`.

3. **Solve the larger problem.**  In step 2, we found the result of a smaller problem.  We want to now use that result to figure out what the result of our current  problem should be, which is what we want to return from our current  function call.

   In our example, we can compute `factorial(n)` by multiplying the result  of our smaller problem `factorial(n-1)` (which represents `(n-1)!`)  by `n` (the reasoning being that `n! = n * (n-1)!`).

The next few questions in lab will have you writing recursive functions. Here are some general tips:

- Paradoxically, to write a recursive function, you must assume that the function is fully functional before you finish writing it; this is called the  *recursive leap of faith*.
- Consider how you can solve the current problem using the solution to  a simpler version of the problem. The amount of work done in a recursive function can be deceptively little: remember to take the leap of faith and *trust the recursion* to solve the slightly smaller problem without worrying about how.
- Think about what the answer would be in the simplest possible case(s). These will be your base cases - the stopping points for your recursive calls. Make sure to consider the possibility that you're  missing base cases (this is a common way recursive solutions fail).
- It may help to write an iterative version first.

## Tree Recursion

A tree recursive function is a recursive function that makes more than one call to itself, resulting in a tree-like series of calls.

For example, let's say we want to recursively calculate the `n`th [Virahanka-Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), defined as:

```
def virfib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n
    return virfib(n - 1) + virfib(n - 2)
```

Calling `virfib(6)` results in the following call structure that looks like an upside-down tree (where `f` is `virfib`):

![image-20211120212907283](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Christina0031/article_imgs/imgs/image-20211120212907283.png)

Each `f(i)` node represents a recursive call to `virfib`. Each recursive call `f(i)` makes another two recursive calls, which are to `f(i-1)` and `f(i-2)`. Whenever we reach a `f(0)` or `f(1)` node, we can directly return `0` or `1` rather than making more recursive calls, since these are our base cases.

In other words, base cases have the information needed to return an answer directly, without depending upon results from other recursive calls. Once we've reached a base case, we can then begin returning back from the recursive calls that led us to the base case in the first place.

**Generally, tree recursion can be effective for problems where there are multiple possibilities or choices at a current state. In these types of problems, you make a recursive call for each choice or for a group of choices.**

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are a compact and powerful way of creating new lists out of sequences. The general syntax for a list comprehension is the following:

```
[<expression> for <element> in <sequence> if <conditional>]
```

where the `if <conditional>` section is optional.

The syntax is designed to read like English: "Compute the expression for each element in the sequence (if the conditional is true for that element)."

```
>>> [i**2 for i in [1, 2, 3, 4] if i % 2 == 0]
[4, 16]
```

This list comprehension will:

- Compute the expression `i**2`
- For each element `i` in the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Where `i % 2 == 0` (`i` is an even number),

and then put the resulting values of the expressions into a new list.

In other words, this list comprehension will create a new list that contains the square of every even element of the original list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

We can also rewrite a list comprehension as an equivalent `for` statement, such as for the example above:

```
>>> lst = []
>>> for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
...     if i % 2 == 0:
...         lst = lst + [i**2]
>>> lst
[4, 16]
```

**Important:** For all WWPD questions, type `Function` if you believe the answer is `<function...>`, `Error` if it errors, and `Nothing` if nothing is displayed.

### Q2: Summation

Write a recursive implementation of `summation`, which takes a positive integer `n` and a function `term`. It applies `term` to every number from `1` to `n` including `n` and returns the sum.

**Important:** Use recursion; the tests will fail if you use any loops (for, while).

```
def summation(n, term):
    """Return the sum of numbers 1 through n (including n) wÃ­th term applied to each number.
    Implement using recursion!

    >>> summation(5, lambda x: x * x * x) # 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3
    225
    >>> summation(9, lambda x: x + 1) # 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
    54
    >>> summation(5, lambda x: 2**x) # 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5
    62
    >>> # Do not use while/for loops!
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> # ban iteration
    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'summation',
    ...       ['While', 'For'])
    True
    """
    assert n >= 1
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

#### Answer

```python
    if n == 1:
        return term(1)
    else:
        return summation(n-1,term) + term(n)
```

#### Solution

```python
    if n == 1:
        return term(n)
    else:
        return term(n) + summation(n - 1, term)
    # Base case: only one item to sum, so we return that item.
    # Recursive call: returns the result of summing the numbers up to n-1 using
    # term. All that's missing is term applied to the current value n.
```

## Tree Recursion

### Q3: Pascal's Triangle

Here's a part of the Pascal's trangle:

```
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

Every number in Pascal's triangle is defined as the sum of the item above it and the item above and to the left of it. Use `0` if the item does not exist.

Define the procedure `pascal(row, column)` which takes a row and a column, and finds the value of the item at that position in Pascal's triangle. Rows and columns are zero-indexed; that is, the first row is row 0 instead of 1 and the first column is column 0 instead of column 1.

For example, the item at row 2, column 1 in Pascal's triangle is 2.

```
def pascal(row, column):
    """Returns the value of the item in Pascal's Triangle 
    whose position is specified by row and column.
    >>> pascal(0, 0)
    1
    >>> pascal(0, 5)	# Empty entry; outside of Pascal's Triangle
    0
    >>> pascal(3, 2)	# Row 3 (1 3 3 1), Column 2
    3
    >>> pascal(4, 2)     # Row 4 (1 4 6 4 1), Column 2
    6
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

#### Answer

```python
    if row == 0 and column == 0:
        return 1
    elif column > row or column < 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return pascal(row - 1, column) + pascal(row - 1, column - 1)
```

#### Solution

```python
    if column == 0:
    	return 1
    elif row == 0:
    	return 0
    else:
    	return pascal(row - 1, column) + pascal(row - 1, column - 1)
```

### Q4: Insect Combinatorics

Consider an insect in an *M* by *N* grid. The insect starts at the bottom left corner, *(0, 0)*, and wants to end up at the top right corner, *(M-1, N-1)*. The insect is only capable of moving right or up. Write a function `paths` that takes a grid length and width and returns the number of different paths the insect can take from the start to the goal. (There is a [closed-form solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression) to this problem, but try to answer it procedurally using recursion.)

![grid](https://cs61a.org/lab/lab04/assets/grid.jpg)

For example, the 2 by 2 grid has a total of two ways for the insect to move from the start to the goal. For the 3 by 3 grid, the insect has 6 diferent paths (only 3 are shown above).

*Hint:* What happens if we hit the top or rightmost edge?

```
def paths(m, n):
    """Return the number of paths from one corner of an
    M by N grid to the opposite corner.

    >>> paths(2, 2)
    2
    >>> paths(5, 7)
    210
    >>> paths(117, 1)
    1
    >>> paths(1, 157)
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

#### Answer

```python
    if m == 1 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return paths(m - 1, n) + paths(m, n - 1)
```

#### Solution

```python
    if m == 1 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return paths(m - 1, n) + paths(m, n - 1)
```

## List Comprehensions

### Q5: Couple

Implement the function `couple`, which takes in two lists and returns a list that contains lists with i-th elements of two sequences coupled together. You can assume the lengths of two sequences are the same. Try using a list comprehension.

> *Hint*: You may find the built in [range](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp) function helpful.

```
def couple(s, t):
    """Return a list of two-element lists in which the i-th element is [s[i], t[i]].

    >>> a = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> b = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> couple(a, b)
    [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
    >>> c = ['c', 6]
    >>> d = ['s', '1']
    >>> couple(c, d)
    [['c', 's'], [6, '1']]
    """
    assert len(s) == len(t)
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

#### Answer

```python
    return [[s[i], t[i]] for i in range(len(s))]
```

#### Solution

```python
    return [[s[i], t[i]] for i in range(0, len(s))]
```
